I don &apos;t care how much you say you love me . I know your feel@@ ings for her haven &apos;t chang@@ ed .
he left home early in the morning so he wouldn &apos;t miss the train .
I had no idea it would put you to so much trou@@ ble .
what the fu@@ ck is going on here ?
the o@@ st@@ rich has win@@ gs , but it cannot f@@ ly .
I was a bit dis@@ appoin@@ ted .
I lost your phone number .
a ro@@ pe was th@@ ro@@ wn into the water .
it being S@@ un@@ day , the sho@@ p was clo@@ sed .
J@@ e@@ an and K@@ ate are tw@@ ins .
who did this ?
how many children do you have ?
it wouldn &apos;t sur@@ prise me .
are you seri@@ ous@@ ly thinking about not going ?
he told the bo@@ ss some co@@ ck@@ am@@ amie story about being sick and nee@@ ding days off from work .
read it to me .
is that all you can talk about - the Intern@@ et ?

Tom found a job as a me@@ chan@@ ic .
I &apos;ll have a n@@ a@@ p after lun@@ ch .

why don &apos;t you stay a while ?
he r@@ an to his mother in the li@@ br@@ ary .
some water , please .
would you please s@@ low down ?
there &apos;s room in@@ side .
Tom was reading a book while list@@ ening to music .
Tom nee@@ ded your help .
we &apos;re all in this together .
may I try it on ?
close your eyes and tell me what you hear .
how does Tom plan to help ?
he &apos;s ad@@ dic@@ ted to j@@ un@@ k food .
you &apos;re all alone .
they ap@@ pro@@ ve .
we &apos;re ready to leave .
I can dri@@ ve to Boston and back on one t@@ ank of g@@ as .
why don &apos;t you pu@@ ll over ?
why don &apos;t you meet me out fr@@ ont in a few minutes ?
Sami feel@@ s so s@@ car@@ ed .
it is necess@@ ary for you to stop smoking .
I &apos;ve never come ac@@ ro@@ ss such a str@@ ange c@@ ase .
the company has hard and fast ru@@ les against l@@ at@@ en@@ ess .
you go@@ tt@@ a get more or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ zed .
she &apos;s a y@@ o@@ g@@ a in@@ struc@@ tor .
nobody ever laugh@@ s at my jo@@ kes .
it &apos;s hard to do that .
once a teacher , always a teacher .
Tom was play@@ ing go@@ l@@ f that morning .
does your dog bi@@ te ?
I just wanted to see what would happen .
brea@@ the , d@@ am@@ n you !
what he said made us angry .
I &apos;ll wait for you in my room .
I &apos;m not your serv@@ ant .
I don &apos;t know wh@@ e@@ ther to c@@ ry or to l@@ au@@ gh .
how come you didn &apos;t call me last night ?
what did you do with that ?
A@@ d@@ ding up num@@ b@@ ers is very up@@ li@@ f@@ ting .
can I make co@@ pi@@ es ?
you won &apos;t di@@ e today .
I hi@@ d it some@@ where .
Sami has been sick .
are you still up@@ set about what happened ?
she used mar@@ gar@@ ine inst@@ ead of bu@@ t@@ ter .
I &apos;ll dri@@ ve you some@@ where .
Tom is ob@@ st@@ in@@ ate .
we have to learn all the son@@ gs before the end of the week .
would you like to visit the city ?
this gu@@ y &apos;s great at p@@ it@@ ching cu@@ r@@ ve@@ b@@ all@@ s .
one wee@@ k@@ end all of the ho@@ tel@@ s in the city were fu@@ ll because there was a large con@@ ven@@ tion .
I didn &apos;t see Tom yesterday .
we still have a few wee@@ ks left .
she got all flu@@ st@@ ered when the boy she likes came over to talk to her .
there &apos;s less of it , but no less to it .
that h@@ at be@@ comes you .
how long does it take to walk from here to the city h@@ all ?
he dre@@ am@@ ed about his home .
they have a ten @-@ year @-@ old son .
he was leav@@ ing then .
I &apos;ll be home by mi@@ d@@ night at the l@@ at@@ est .
I don &apos;t think they al@@ low that .
come again ?
I saw the c@@ ake you made .
Tom and Mary have decided to get married in O@@ c@@ to@@ ber .
where are your friends going ?
as the door s@@ li@@ d open , he almost fell on@@ to the pl@@ at@@ for@@ m .
can you use a com@@ puter ?
that &apos;s a lot of cas@@ h .
he &apos;s not a bad person .
if I tell him the truth , she will never for@@ give me .
you should have seen her .
some day we &apos;ll take a trip to In@@ di@@ a .
what time do you want me to pic@@ k you up ?
you got what you wanted , didn &apos;t you ?
I can &apos;t walk anymore .
I@@ r@@ an is not I@@ ra@@ q .
his de@@ b@@ ts am@@ oun@@ t to two mil@@ li@@ on dollars .
Tom &apos;s eyes were fu@@ ll of t@@ ears .
what is today &apos;s d@@ ate ?
I &apos;ve mis@@ sed you so much , Tom .
should I tell him that I like him or that I love him ?
I have nothing to f@@ ear .
I just in@@ v@@ ent@@ ed a new word @-@ pro@@ c@@ es@@ so@@ r en@@ ab@@ ling to pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce them b@@ ac@@ k@@ war@@ ds .
the old man started to l@@ au@@ gh s@@ ad@@ ly .
I &apos;m ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job .
who will correct my mist@@ a@@ kes ?
do you think it was easy for me ?
I s@@ cre@@ am@@ ed but nobody could hear me .
can anyone dri@@ ve ?
I am very ill at ea@@ se with str@@ ang@@ ers .
do you want me to tell Tom that we won &apos;t do that ?
two wee@@ ks have pass@@ ed and I haven &apos;t seen you .
don &apos;t look !
why don &apos;t you love me ?
Tom wants to buy a b@@ ass gu@@ it@@ ar , but he doesn &apos;t have enough money .
I know you see it , but are you really looking at it ?
I cannot put up with her be@@ hav@@ i@@ or .
any of you can do it .
I remember what I saw .
they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that they &apos;d li@@ ed .
I don &apos;t like swimming in po@@ o@@ ls .
can you understand the me@@ an@@ ing of this senten@@ ce ?
the man was hi@@ ding in a den@@ se for@@ est .
I know that this is we@@ ir@@ d .
that would make sense .
no one had seen anything .
I have no si@@ bl@@ ings .
what &apos;s the go@@ l@@ d@@ en ru@@ le ?
he can har@@ d@@ ly speak any English .
I had my watch m@@ end@@ ed .
we can help you .
are you in@@ vol@@ ved in poli@@ ti@@ c@@ s ?
b@@ low out the c@@ and@@ les .
I wasn &apos;t enti@@ r@@ ely sure myself .
you don &apos;t have to lie .
it was a beautiful night .
I think you made the right cho@@ ice .
the truth is I told a lie .
Tom has the experi@@ ence necess@@ ary .
how do you stop this ?
you have too many ir@@ ons in the fi@@ re .
but it &apos;s me who should thank you .
he came while I was still as@@ le@@ ep .
I took over the bus@@ in@@ ess from F@@ a@@ ther .
o@@ il is ex@@ pen@@ sive .
where did Tom buy it ?
I bought a house .
do you know who we are ?
it &apos;s as old as the world .
Dan an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced that he and L@@ in@@ da were getting di@@ v@@ or@@ ced .
I have a vis@@ a .
it will be a great plea@@ sure for me to trans@@ late the story and to read it to you .
what &apos;s with the lu@@ gg@@ age ?
something is asked of me .
it &apos;s like being a k@@ id in a c@@ and@@ y store .
M@@ ath@@ s is a good sub@@ j@@ ect .
you really speak French well .
for exam@@ ple , more people are cho@@ o@@ sing to live together and have children without getting married .
are you seri@@ ous@@ ly thinking about going ?
it was a plea@@ sure meeting you , Tom .
if you don &apos;t eat , you &apos;ll di@@ e .
I don &apos;t know why Tom doesn &apos;t like Boston .
I don &apos;t have the right e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment .
I r@@ an out@@ side and the door lo@@ c@@ ked it@@ self behind me .
it would be coun@@ ter @-@ produ@@ c@@ tive to do such a thing .
what do you want ?
I &apos;m waiting im@@ pati@@ ent@@ ly .
S@@ p@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ a was a pan@@ the@@ ist .
I like both sci@@ ence and mat@@ h .
we &apos;re not cert@@ ain of that yet .
I know it &apos;s not im@@ possible .
I work in the morning .
Tom has re@@ ques@@ ted my as@@ sist@@ ance .
do you want to get us both killed ?
they all speak French .
why are you so good at ex@@ pl@@ ain@@ ing things ?
no one will stop me .
I &apos;m a trai@@ ne@@ e .
how much are you being p@@ aid to do this ?
she was lo@@ ved by everybody in the village .
where do you train your students ?
have you seen my cam@@ era ?
I hear you were gr@@ oun@@ ded .
this book is too large to go in my po@@ cket .
could you please over@@ look it this time ?
when I was your age , I had a bo@@ y@@ friend .
I hate that gu@@ y .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t have a brother .
he bor@@ ro@@ w@@ ed the car from his friend .
this TV was made in Ch@@ in@@ a .
I feel sick every morning .
you should know yourself .
he took this photo .
would you like to read this mag@@ az@@ ine ?
he took char@@ ge of the fir@@ m after his father &apos;s death .
Tom and I usu@@ ally tal@@ ked to each other in French .
I f@@ illed up the v@@ ase with water .
it doesn &apos;t matter who s@@ ays that , it &apos;s not true .
this is how I made it .
do you know how to play ch@@ ess ?
this bicy@@ cle is mine . yours is over there .
it &apos;s an em@@ er@@ gen@@ c@@ y !
for me , the re@@ al world is just a fic@@ tion .
spea@@ king of fil@@ ms , why not go to the cin@@ em@@ a tonight ?
Tom felt his phone vi@@ br@@ ate .
will it be f@@ ine tomorrow ?
I never really gave it much thought .
Tom likes living in Boston .
anything you want , my d@@ ear .
she attr@@ ac@@ ted me at first si@@ ght .
that is the f@@ un@@ ni@@ est jo@@ ke that I have ever heard .
he prom@@ is@@ ed to pro@@ vi@@ de information .
I &apos;m ta@@ king care of it . you can rel@@ a@@ x . you can r@@ ely on me .
are you still sick ?
I &apos;ve just spo@@ ken to your French teacher and he s@@ ays you &apos;re doing well in his class .
everybody &apos;s in a hurry these days .
she likes to go to the li@@ br@@ ary .
everyone is waiting in the other room .
it mat@@ ters to me .
the cold air re@@ viv@@ ed Tom .
are you out of your mind ?
she tem@@ p@@ ted him .
everyone can make a differ@@ ence in their own lives and th@@ er@@ e@@ by coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ ely make the world a better place for th@@ em@@ sel@@ ves and others around them .
you &apos;re not in a hurry , are you ?
let &apos;s come back to it l@@ ater .
I should talk to Tom .
you &apos;d better stay with me .
once u@@ po@@ n a time there lived an em@@ per@@ or who was a great con@@ qu@@ er@@ or , and re@@ ig@@ ned over more coun@@ tri@@ es than anyone in the world .
can you come to the party ?
don &apos;t s@@ pl@@ as@@ h me !
Tom har@@ d@@ ly spo@@ ke any French when I first met him .
I don &apos;t have enough money for my trip .
there &apos;s only one pretty child in the world , and every mother has it .
J@@ ac@@ ques made it clear that he wanted to meet M@@ r G@@ ag@@ non .
everyone is free to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te .
Tom was mu@@ gg@@ ed on his way home from work .
they made sure nobody could see them .
a gu@@ y ne@@ ar@@ ly r@@ an into us .
I think we have some un@@ finished bus@@ in@@ ess .
I &apos;ve lost my f@@ ill@@ ing .
do you think that &apos;s true ?
if you would be a good read@@ er , read ; if a wri@@ ter , write .
I hate those sp@@ i@@ der@@ s . they &apos;re always there to f@@ re@@ a@@ k me out when I &apos;m cle@@ an@@ ing .
no such person ex@@ i@@ sts .
do your best !
I gave up hope .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him to cut down on smoking .
no matter how much I think about it , I can &apos;t understand it .
she told him a jo@@ ke .
can you put the children to bed ?
Marie &apos;s hi@@ ding something from me .
did you go to Tom &apos;s party last S@@ at@@ ur@@ day ?
he w@@ ro@@ te a no@@ v@@ el bas@@ ed on an@@ ci@@ ent my@@ ths .
Tom went ro@@ ck cli@@ m@@ b@@ ing .
she didn &apos;t like this game .
they &apos;ve known each other for a very long time .
don &apos;t tou@@ ch this !
you &apos;ve been war@@ ned .
he pl@@ ays the piano very well .
what makes you so sure Tom was the one who sto@@ le your bicy@@ cle ?
she has good ide@@ as .
what a hor@@ ri@@ ble thing !
we have no cho@@ ice but to give up the whole plan .
you &apos;re a trai@@ tor .
we take ris@@ ks all the time .
Z@@ ai@@ l@@ ai@@ b@@ a b@@ ar is hi@@ ring wai@@ ters ; are you interested ?
I can &apos;t li@@ ft my right ar@@ m .
I tried fl@@ ying from the top of the t@@ ree .
this pri@@ est is a good man .
I sometimes lie on the gr@@ ass .
Tom thought Mary was saf@@ e .
I just want to know why you br@@ ought me here .
open the door .
it &apos;s almost hard to believe all these beautiful things were made by hand such a long time ago .
we as@@ su@@ me that he is hon@@ est .
are you all right ?
wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever road you may take , it will l@@ ead to the station .
if I were you , I &apos;d buy that one .
he makes himself acc@@ es@@ sible to all who see@@ k his coun@@ se@@ l .
I &apos;m sorry I mi@@ sun@@ der@@ sto@@ od you .
where can I find a tax@@ i ?
she &apos;s going through a mi@@ d@@ life cri@@ s@@ is .
the res@@ cu@@ ed re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es were long@@ ing for f@@ re@@ e@@ d@@ om .
stop suc@@ king up to the teacher .
re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ d@@ ly s@@ l@@ am@@ ming the c@@ lu@@ t@@ ch pe@@ d@@ al , I some@@ how man@@ ag@@ ed to get the c@@ lu@@ t@@ ch dis@@ en@@ gag@@ ed so I could just about dri@@ ve for the time being .
they did not believe me .
we know you &apos;re interested .
the house is bur@@ ning !
we consi@@ der Tom hon@@ est .
I &apos;ll give you a sim@@ ple exam@@ ple .
win@@ ds from the se@@ a are mo@@ ist .
we have arrived saf@@ e and s@@ ound .
we are going to leave tomorrow .
M@@ r W@@ il@@ son is pr@@ ou@@ d of his house .
are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
the meeting will be hel@@ d regar@@ d@@ less of the weather .
in the A@@ r@@ c@@ tic there are no pen@@ gu@@ ins .
she &apos;s young , n@@ ai@@ ve and in@@ experi@@ enc@@ ed .
