I don &apos;t suppose there &apos;s much chance of that hap@@ pen@@ ing .
H@@ ey , don &apos;t do that !
I understand why .
life is not an exac@@ t sci@@ ence , it is an art .
my mother al@@ low@@ ed me to go ab@@ road .
he se@@ ar@@ ched his po@@ ck@@ ets for the key .
I still live at my d@@ ad &apos;s place .
D@@ u@@ bli@@ n is in I@@ rel@@ and .
please put the light out when you leave the room .
I had is@@ su@@ es I had to d@@ eal with .
I &apos;m going to start .
she was born lu@@ cky .
the hai@@ l cr@@ ac@@ ked the window .
if you could do that for me , I &apos;d app@@ reci@@ ate it .
some water , please .
I app@@ reci@@ ate your telling me .
you will find this in a har@@ d@@ w@@ are store .
these are my grand@@ mother &apos;s arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al te@@ et@@ h .
what is this place ?
no .
where can I get a c@@ a@@ b ?
we had a re@@ al good time .
it was kind of fun .
he felt it was his du@@ ty to go .
read between the l@@ ines .
what are some fo@@ ods you usu@@ ally eat with your children ?
the bi@@ gg@@ est concer@@ n is cost .
a little n@@ a@@ p and , just like that , I &apos;m as fr@@ es@@ h as a d@@ ais@@ y .
we &apos;ll d@@ eal with it in the morning .
we have people every@@ where .
you have to pay the pri@@ ce .
we wal@@ ked more qu@@ ick@@ ly than usu@@ al .
we live .
I hel@@ ped Tom .
don &apos;t do anything stupi@@ d .
in order to make this c@@ ake you need b@@ a@@ king po@@ w@@ der and un@@ sal@@ ted bu@@ t@@ ter .
An@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating a cold win@@ ter , we bought a bi@@ g@@ ger sto@@ ve .
I &apos;m sorry , but I don &apos;t understand .
m@@ em@@ ori@@ ze it well .
co@@ ws are sac@@ red to many people in In@@ di@@ a .
the ro@@ of is really in need of re@@ p@@ air .
correct er@@ r@@ ors .
they &apos;re brother and sister .
I just wanted to say thank you .
he has very little inter@@ est in his children .
I like K@@ ev@@ in N@@ as@@ h .
how do you for@@ m the pl@@ ur@@ al of n@@ oun@@ s ?
the work is mo@@ st@@ ly done .
Tom tal@@ ked too much and let the secret s@@ li@@ p .
what are you afraid of ?
Tom killed a man .
I really like you .
your trou@@ bles are just beg@@ in@@ ning .
can you trans@@ late a love letter ?
I do not know why I said that .
I will per@@ for@@ m my du@@ ti@@ es with plea@@ sure .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s going to rain .
I &apos;ll tell my d@@ ad !
he got very angry , for she re@@ f@@ used to fol@@ low his advice .
we are not rich .
at@@ om@@ ic en@@ erg@@ y can be used for p@@ ea@@ c@@ eful ends .
I will go if you go .
stop y@@ el@@ ling .
there are only 10 minutes left until the end of the les@@ son .
Sami has a ri@@ de .
she doesn &apos;t want him to pic@@ k the flow@@ ers .
I want you to remember this moment .
there used to be a store right here .
two small bo@@ tt@@ les , please .
I knew you had a bo@@ y@@ friend !
there is an ur@@ gent need for the lo@@ cal go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment to help the hom@@ el@@ ess .
you &apos;ve been had .
there is nothing left to eat .
I can &apos;t stand being tre@@ ated like a child .
I was di@@ agno@@ sed with p@@ n@@ eu@@ mon@@ ia .
rec@@ ent@@ ly there have been a lot of pro@@ t@@ es@@ ts in the city .
I &apos;ll make you a new su@@ it .
the company is@@ su@@ ed a pr@@ ess rel@@ ea@@ se .
it &apos;s ab@@ sur@@ d of you to do that .
I &apos;m going to take my car .
I wanted to speak to you about this .
have you anything to dec@@ l@@ are ?
he has no bicy@@ cle .
are you s@@ aying I have no sense of hu@@ mo@@ r ?
today is not so cold .
wom@@ en have beau@@ ty , but do books not al@@ so have beau@@ ty ?
where was your father ?
the inter@@ n is l@@ azy .
I have a little something for you .
I like to in@@ vent us@@ eful things .
students study in school .
anyone who is not sho@@ c@@ ked by qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m the@@ ory has not under@@ sto@@ od it .
we would have hel@@ ped them .
my TV is bro@@ ken .
we have enough .
I got into a fi@@ ght .
it is a sup@@ er idea .
don &apos;t tell him I told you .
I had no idea you were in@@ vol@@ ved .
for the past few years , te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers who im@@ it@@ ate over@@ we@@ ight am@@ er@@ ic@@ an rap@@ per@@ s have been wal@@ king like in@@ ver@@ ted pend@@ u@@ lu@@ ms , sw@@ in@@ g@@ ing from left to right , which is the only way for@@ ward if you we@@ ig@@ h over two hun@@ d@@ red and si@@ x@@ ty pou@@ n@@ ds , but compl@@ et@@ ely in@@ eff@@ ec@@ tive if you are a s@@ cr@@ aw@@ ny te@@ en@@ ager we@@ i@@ gh@@ ing hal@@ f of that , since most of the en@@ erg@@ y is was@@ ted on side st@@ e@@ ps , not to men@@ tion the sh@@ e@@ er ab@@ sur@@ di@@ ty of that sw@@ in@@ g@@ ing g@@ ait .
Sami &apos;s plan@@ e has@@ n &apos;t even ta@@ ken off .
you should have spo@@ ken more poli@@ tel@@ y .
if it &apos;s that hot , how about you take off all your clo@@ th@@ es ?
I don &apos;t have a ti@@ cket .
she is my mother @-@ in @-@ la@@ w .
Tom wasn &apos;t w@@ ear@@ ing sho@@ es .
br@@ ing me a cu@@ p of coffee , please .
so , what else is going on ?
you will find the restaurant on your right .
is Tom still play@@ ing ?
two th@@ ous@@ and people fit into this h@@ all .
he has this large room to himself .
don &apos;t you ever come here again !
I got into trou@@ ble with the police by dri@@ ving too fast .

they were all here .
I think that you have been br@@ ain@@ was@@ hed .

I sw@@ ear to G@@ od this is true .
I thought I had a good chance .
he told me that his father &apos;s a teacher .
he wasn &apos;t a good mus@@ ici@@ an .
in the cen@@ ter of the univers@@ ity cam@@ p@@ us stand@@ s the st@@ at@@ ue of the f@@ oun@@ der .
I &apos;m not quite finished yet .
I know who he is .
really ? I thought she &apos;d be the last person to get married .
I wonder why I didn &apos;t think of that .
we exp@@ ect heav@@ y res@@ ist@@ ance .
I &apos;ll try to pay this b@@ ill tomorrow .
Tom left everything to Mary in his will .
I &apos;m not as s@@ mar@@ t as you .
we need a pass@@ word to use this com@@ puter .
du@@ ring the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar &quot; An@@ ne of G@@ re@@ en G@@ ables &quot; was dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ ted by the P@@ o@@ lis@@ h go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment to tro@@ o@@ ps in the tr@@ en@@ ches to re@@ mind them of what they were fi@@ gh@@ ting for .
pri@@ ces are high .
would you be friends with me ?
I can &apos;t go out because I have a lot of hom@@ e@@ work .
if you get bit by a r@@ ab@@ id dog , you &apos;ll need a t@@ et@@ an@@ us shot .
I &apos;m not ready for this .
I ag@@ ree with what you say to some ex@@ t@@ ent .
he put the key in the lo@@ ck .
this time , you &apos;ve g@@ one too far .
they were not im@@ press@@ ed .
I &apos;ve never vo@@ ted .

I can har@@ d@@ ly brea@@ the .

O@@ K , very good .
you should stay in the ho@@ sp@@ ital for tre@@ at@@ ment .
could you please tell me again who your father is ?

everyone started laugh@@ ing .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
I even w@@ ro@@ te a letter to her .

we have way too much work to do .
he is de@@ e@@ pl@@ y att@@ ach@@ ed to her .

I as@@ sure you this is about much more than money .
did you forget to do your hom@@ e@@ work ?
I &apos;ve got a br@@ and new bi@@ ke .
Tom knew what Mary had done .
he is h@@ ated by all .
I don &apos;t bi@@ te .
this will only take a secon@@ d .
Tom and Mary are living in France since yesterday .
we lost .
he went into re@@ h@@ a@@ b .
we must think about these pl@@ ans in ter@@ ms of what they would cost .
he &apos;s feel@@ ing much better .
Tom sin@@ gs in a ch@@ ur@@ ch cho@@ ir .
he felt un@@ easy in his father &apos;s pres@@ ence .
am I the only one who didn &apos;t understand what was going on ?
the st@@ or@@ m did great d@@ am@@ age to her pro@@ per@@ ty .
I &apos;m sorry for the pain I c@@ aus@@ ed you and your family .
I lost my wife in a tr@@ aff@@ ic accident .
nothing has g@@ one right all day .

he dro@@ p@@ ped the an@@ cho@@ vi@@ es .
you &apos;re out of your mind .
do you mind if we come in ?
it &apos;s very cold , this win@@ ter !
this is bad .
as far as I am concer@@ ned , I am not against your opinion .
he sel@@ d@@ om or@@ der@@ s anything new .
I quite co@@ tt@@ on@@ ed on to that man .
he came run@@ ning .
he is not himself today .
it &apos;s not going to be easy to fin@@ ish this job on time .

I ad@@ ded his name to the li@@ st .
thank you for your efforts .
I need to see you in my office .
the co@@ sts are too high .
I would like you to think about what you would have done in my place .
don &apos;t m@@ ess with me !
I feel very str@@ on@@ g@@ ly about that .
she o@@ w@@ es me money .
can you leave me alone ?
Tom told me he wasn &apos;t happy here .
this little girl lives in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il .
I feel like someone just wal@@ ked over my gr@@ ave .
give me ch@@ ap@@ ter and ver@@ se .
can you come over and talk ?
I know that Tom might want to learn how to do that .
our gar@@ d@@ en produ@@ ced an ab@@ un@@ dance of c@@ ab@@ b@@ ages last year .
why don &apos;t we talk in your office ?
Tom didn &apos;t show up for work yesterday .
I must find out who is behind this .
I thought you &apos;d want to meet my family .
I can &apos;t stand this hot weather .
give us the det@@ ails .
she w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed him being killed .
I &apos;ll never give up .
I was tr@@ app@@ ed in a vi@@ ci@@ ous cir@@ cle .
Mary &apos;s sister knew all about Tom &apos;s secre@@ ts .
you should be more careful the next time .
Tom makes a lot of mist@@ a@@ kes .
it will be ready soon .
there &apos;s a com@@ par@@ ati@@ v@@ ely large cin@@ em@@ a compl@@ e@@ x in@@ side the m@@ all .
who &apos;s hi@@ ding behind the cu@@ r@@ tain ?
ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly , you vo@@ lun@@ te@@ ered .

the weather is good .
do you really want to w@@ in ?
most of them ur@@ g@@ ed him to take the job .
Sami came to give Layla her gi@@ ft .
nothing was f@@ un@@ ny .
I never lo@@ ved you .
let &apos;s talk man to man .
I can &apos;t do that with you because I don &apos;t have enough money .
Tom is bor@@ ing , isn &apos;t he ?
I didn &apos;t sleep long enough .
we are living through a bi@@ o@@ di@@ vers@@ ity cri@@ s@@ is .
I know something &apos;s wrong .
I just don &apos;t want to go with you .
really ? I didn &apos;t know she was your sister .
he &apos;s working at his English .
they live on the f@@ lo@@ or b@@ en@@ e@@ ath .
there is a pon@@ d in the mi@@ dd@@ le of the par@@ k .
don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll be right back .
she spea@@ ks too much .
no tax@@ i st@@ op@@ ped .
you must not stop on the hard sh@@ oul@@ der to go to the to@@ il@@ et .
something is wrong with the eng@@ ine of this car .
I was surprised by the news this morning .
Tom g@@ ets up@@ set eas@@ ily .
this man is a le@@ g@@ end .
enjo@@ y your m@@ eal ! did you already start ?
you &apos;re a s@@ no@@ b .
I figu@@ red I could coun@@ t on you .
we &apos;d like another bo@@ ttle of wine .
may I put it down here ?
if Tom has a problem with me , he should tell me .
at what time is dinner ser@@ ved ?
I asked him for advice .
she is always for@@ getting my phone number .
what has become of him since then ?
she doesn &apos;t study as hard as her sister .
you would like it .
the pri@@ ce is reas@@ on@@ able .
In@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ es in@@ cre@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly became g@@ ear@@ ed for ou@@ ter sp@@ ace .
she likes no one and no one likes her .
just pre@@ ten@@ d you don &apos;t know me .
the name of my country is wri@@ tten without any arti@@ cle .
the in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ alis@@ ed world is used to us@@ ing water prof@@ li@@ g@@ at@@ ely .
thank you for your det@@ ai@@ led ex@@ plan@@ ation .
you &apos;re my her@@ o , Sami .
my le@@ gs are wea@@ k .
she doesn &apos;t know the ti@@ t@@ le of the book you &apos;re talking about .
let &apos;s talk sho@@ p for a while .
she pou@@ red the milk into a bo@@ w@@ l .
run hot water into the bat@@ h .
she tre@@ ated me b@@ ad@@ ly .
may I have your order , please ?
the radi@@ o is a bit l@@ ou@@ d .
Mary is a y@@ o@@ d@@ el@@ er .
he k@@ ept on laugh@@ ing at me .
I could tell you about be@@ e@@ kee@@ ping for hours , but I don &apos;t want to bo@@ re you .
don &apos;t all speak at once .
it was very cold .
I &apos;m getting tired of looking at fu@@ r@@ n@@ itu@@ re we can &apos;t aff@@ or@@ d .
he wants you to come home .
you &apos;re early .
I found the em@@ p@@ ty bo@@ x .
she made him rich .
he was stand@@ ing at the top of the m@@ oun@@ tain .
she le@@ an@@ ed to@@ war@@ ds me .
this is what I wanted .
you re@@ mind me of myself when I was your age .
these pi@@ ec@@ es of fu@@ r@@ n@@ itu@@ re are not for sa@@ le .
I love what you &apos;ve done to this place .
I am lear@@ ning Ger@@ man .
please close the door behind you .
have you made a li@@ st yet ?
without o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en , all anim@@ als would have dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed long ago .
why &apos;s Tom still here ?
we need money .
it &apos;s my fau@@ l@@ t , not yours .
no one is am@@ used .
I wonder why you would like so much to learn English .
while we were having te@@ a , there was an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake .
ei@@ ther they don &apos;t want to or they can &apos;t .
what is in your hands ?
we need you .
I &apos;ll just leave .
I went to the mar@@ ket .
it was one of the most re@@ war@@ ding experi@@ ences of my life .
he is respon@@ sible for the accident .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re consi@@ der@@ ing doing that .
I can think of s@@ ever@@ al reas@@ ons .
you might get hurt .
you &apos;re the only one who can help .
when was the last time you tal@@ ked to Tom ?
do you really think Tom is happy ?
you &apos;ve been in@@ f@@ ected .
there were six sh@@ ee@@ p in the fi@@ el@@ d .
are you thinking about getting a job ?
I &apos;m still not sure .
if you fe@@ ed your dog pro@@ per@@ ly , you can in@@ cre@@ ase his li@@ f@@ esp@@ an .
the st@@ re@@ et in fr@@ ont of my house is pretty n@@ ar@@ row .
when are we going to leave ?
my br@@ ain is fri@@ ed .
a new road is under con@@ struc@@ tion .
Tom had a little accident .
they k@@ ept drin@@ king .
did you read it enti@@ r@@ ely ?
she &apos;s two years youn@@ ger than him .
our teacher often over@@ loo@@ ked his name on the li@@ st .
Tom still o@@ w@@ es me a lot of money .
get the h@@ ell out my way !
be careful !
the popul@@ ation of Japan is lar@@ ger than that of N@@ e@@ w Z@@ e@@ al@@ and .
I &apos;d pre@@ fer not to eat that .

the pain has l@@ ess@@ en@@ ed a little .
I wish I could ex@@ pl@@ ain to you how important this is to me .
any chance you know where I put my k@@ ey@@ s ?
that &apos;s terri@@ ble advice .
I &apos;ve come a long way .
you &apos;re all set ?
that &apos;s ab@@ solu@@ te n@@ on@@ sense !
the teacher pun@@ ished her students for us@@ ing bad words .
how can you ac@@ cu@@ se me of such a thing ? I would never l@@ ay a hand on my child .
Tom is thir@@ st@@ y .
he has a S@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n acc@@ ent .
don &apos;t give them to her .
I was ready today .
the problem is the@@ irs .
in times of cri@@ s@@ is one should never ide@@ ali@@ se the past .
you can &apos;t s@@ it there .
I like to swim in the af@@ ter@@ noon .

I didn &apos;t even know you spo@@ ke French .
we get together once a year .
that was Tom &apos;s cou@@ s@@ in .
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;d want to live here .

I am con@@ vin@@ ced that he is in@@ no@@ cent .

I don &apos;t know what Tom and Mary are waiting for .
there &apos;s no w@@ ind today .
there were no fen@@ ces on the great pl@@ ains .
Tom doesn &apos;t know my name .
I think it would have been a better sho@@ ot with a 1@@ 0@@ m@@ m l@@ ens .
gen@@ i@@ us is only one re@@ mo@@ ve from in@@ san@@ ity .
I &apos;m going to show you the photo .
get rich !

experi@@ ence is the best teacher .
Tom was on TV yesterday .
pain@@ ting is very easy when you do not know how to do it . when you know , it &apos;s very difficult .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
how did they get in here ?
I wonder if Tom will tell Mary the truth .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late . the meeting compl@@ et@@ ely s@@ li@@ p@@ ped my mind .
food is necess@@ ary for life .

enjo@@ y yourself to the fu@@ ll@@ est .
Tom told me that he h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t done that yet .
I am right .
I wonder how many people saw Tom doing that .
T@@ okyo is a very ex@@ pen@@ sive place to live .
don &apos;t tell me that again .
I &apos;m bo@@ red . let &apos;s do something fun .
I &apos;m sure Tom in@@ tend@@ ed to do that .
the fir@@ m has its head office in O@@ sa@@ k@@ a .
today , I was with a friend at the swimming po@@ ol .
Tom put some o@@ at milk in his coffee .
I made him sw@@ ee@@ p the f@@ lo@@ or .

my daughter likes to play with doll@@ s .

he is a g@@ ent@@ l@@ em@@ an .
you &apos;re very ti@@ mi@@ d .
I have a red home .
the teacher can see you .
nobody knows exactly how many rac@@ es make up the popul@@ ation of the U@@ n@@ ited S@@ t@@ ates .
the tre@@ es will soon be b@@ are .
I thought she was stupi@@ d .
I aw@@ o@@ ke to find everything had been a dre@@ am .
she knows her@@ self well .
how many times have you been in love in your life ?
do you eat ri@@ ce every day ?
har@@ d@@ ly had he en@@ ter@@ ed the room , when she bur@@ st into t@@ ears .
I &apos;m not as afraid of he@@ i@@ gh@@ ts as I used to be .
you &apos;ll be saf@@ e with her .
how long does it take by car ?
can we get some help ?
you must take ad@@ v@@ antage of the op@@ port@@ un@@ ity .
I o@@ pened a bo@@ ttle of red wine .
you have a great imag@@ in@@ ation .
she vo@@ lun@@ te@@ ered to go to the meeting with him .
she &apos;s really s@@ mar@@ t , isn &apos;t she ?
you &apos;d better eat everything that &apos;s on your pl@@ ate .
I ad@@ mit I was surprised .
when will you re@@ turn ?
you can &apos;t just come in here and start or@@ der@@ ing people around .
what is the use of ph@@ il@@ o@@ so@@ ph@@ y ?
I was us@@ her@@ ed to my se@@ at .
I had something plan@@ ned .
Tom has trav@@ el@@ ed around the world .
Tom never gave up .
I don &apos;t really want to have another child .
the n@@ un pr@@ ayed and cro@@ s@@ sed her@@ self .
I think I &apos;d ra@@ ther not know .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him where he should stay .
new bl@@ an@@ k@@ ets were dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ ted to the poor .
tell them what happened .
it did not come off .
I promise you I &apos;ll keep you saf@@ e .

H@@ o@@ ly Tom !

the go@@ l@@ d@@ fish is ali@@ ve .
she ur@@ g@@ ed him to consi@@ der the re@@ qu@@ est .
it &apos;ll be easy to find someone to do that .
like it ?
you didn &apos;t let me answer .
G@@ re@@ et@@ ings , str@@ anger .
have you seen him before ?
the t@@ ree fell over in the ty@@ pho@@ on .
what kind of music does Tom like ?
this ti@@ cket is v@@ ali@@ d for three days .
I &apos;m in@@ no@@ cent .

they came last week .
there are 10 ty@@ p@@ es of people in the world : those who understand b@@ in@@ ary , and those who don &apos;t .
I was hi@@ dd@@ en .

I never felt com@@ for@@ table around your parents .
there was blo@@ od on Tom &apos;s shi@@ rt .

give me your ad@@ dress .
Tom and Mary were in love with each other .
S@@ and@@ ra has gro@@ wn up to be a beautiful woman .
I &apos;d su@@ gg@@ est that you cle@@ an up a bit before your mother g@@ ets here .
here &apos;s where the fun beg@@ ins .
could you ad@@ d me ?
I suppose we have nothing to lo@@ se .
I wanted you to see that I &apos;m not all that bad .
I &apos;m afraid that Tom is in@@ vol@@ ved in a cri@@ me .
if your answer is correct , it fol@@ lo@@ ws that mine is wrong .
Tom and Mary had their hon@@ ey@@ mo@@ on in a fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n l@@ and .
we tried to che@@ er her up .
they bur@@ ned all the do@@ cu@@ ments .
you &apos;re the same age as my gir@@ l@@ friend .
I have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
no one believ@@ ed you .
the h@@ all was dec@@ or@@ ated with Japanese pain@@ t@@ ings .
if I were in your place , I would l@@ end him a hand .
nobody su@@ sp@@ ected anything .
I don &apos;t have much money now .
she made me hurry .
they ir@@ on@@ ed out their differ@@ ences .
these aren &apos;t my k@@ ey@@ s .
we are having lun@@ ch .

it &apos;s time for us to get ready .
if he doesn &apos;t come , we won &apos;t go .
what &apos;s wrong with you tonight ?
I can &apos;t believe that you aren &apos;t at le@@ ast w@@ ill@@ ing to consi@@ der the pos@@ si@@ bili@@ ty of other al@@ tern@@ ati@@ ves .
you don &apos;t have to come .
I can fin@@ ally see the light at the end of the t@@ un@@ nel .
I was compl@@ et@@ ely dev@@ as@@ t@@ ated .
he turned his th@@ ou@@ gh@@ ts to@@ ward home .
you don &apos;t need to come so early .
I asked Tom if he nee@@ ded more money .
Tom knows that he can w@@ in .
I am very tired from the hard work .
I &apos;ve already told everybody to go home .
Tom never re@@ ach@@ ed Austr@@ ali@@ a .
we should have set off ear@@ li@@ er .
I me@@ an to go tomorrow if the weather is f@@ ine .
may comes after A@@ pri@@ l .
his death was a great lo@@ ss to our fir@@ m .
my ol@@ der brother is an au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty on ph@@ il@@ o@@ so@@ ph@@ y .
everybody nee@@ ds to cal@@ m down .
there &apos;s a great restaurant around the cor@@ ner .
children f@@ illed the room .
why wouldn &apos;t you let me tell you what happened ?
it &apos;s r@@ ain@@ ing c@@ ats and do@@ gs .
it &apos;s an ex@@ cu@@ se .
I think so .
you look ner@@ vous .
I like being alone .
I have a few easy questions for you .
hurry up , girls .
do you think this j@@ el@@ ly &apos;s fir@@ m enough to eat yet ?
I was on a trip to In@@ di@@ a .
he was my mat@@ h teacher .
you &apos;re cr@@ af@@ ty .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the differ@@ ence between a vir@@ us and a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ia .
what do you want to talk to me about ?
the boy was se@@ ar@@ ching for the lost key .
su@@ g@@ ar dis@@ sol@@ ves in water .
it felt pretty good .
do you have a table on the pati@@ o ?
you &apos;ll find this les@@ son easy .
believe me . I &apos;ll be a new man .
if only I could already speak Ger@@ man flu@@ ent@@ ly !
I want you to have a job that you love .
are Tom and Mary sure ?
I still don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re talking about .
Tom was like a brother to me .
I don &apos;t want to play with you any more .
be on your gu@@ ard against pic@@ k@@ po@@ ck@@ ets .
the girls are exc@@ ited .
what time &apos;s your train ?
he sp@@ un her around , took her in his ar@@ ms , di@@ p@@ ped her back , and gave her a big H@@ o@@ ll@@ y@@ wo@@ od kis@@ s .
Tom is usu@@ ally very qui@@ et , isn &apos;t he ?
why is au@@ tu@@ m@@ n called &quot; f@@ all &quot; in Americ@@ a ?
in my opinion , he is correct .
I have enough money to buy it .
are there any ban@@ an@@ as ?
he is a scienti@@ st .
Tom wanted me to learn French .
the C@@ old W@@ ar end@@ ed when the S@@ o@@ vi@@ et U@@ ni@@ on coll@@ ap@@ sed .

your wish is a comm@@ and for me .
he would not take the money .
she made a lot of money .
this app@@ le is s@@ our .
did you have a pl@@ eas@@ ant trip ?
Tom never gi@@ ves anything to any@@ body .
H@@ el@@ en K@@ el@@ ler was bl@@ ind , d@@ ea@@ f and du@@ m@@ b .
she didn &apos;t exactly ag@@ ree with me .
I am won@@ der@@ ing if I could be of any ser@@ vice to you .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s father .
I like all of the son@@ gs Tom sin@@ gs .
D@@ e@@ fen@@ es@@ tr@@ ate your clo@@ ck to see how time f@@ li@@ es .
Tom has a black cat .
any@@ way , if you want to know more about my country , I &apos;ll s@@ end you a letter when I get home .
children play in this par@@ k every day .
it r@@ ains so@@ f@@ tly on the city .
more and more young people are going under the k@@ ni@@ fe to im@@ pro@@ ve their ph@@ y@@ si@@ cal ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance .
I would like to trav@@ el alone .
she is more char@@ ming that the others .
it &apos;s your dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing arro@@ g@@ ance that makes you compl@@ et@@ ely in@@ suff@@ er@@ able .

will they go out tomorrow ?
we want to go to France .
are you going to s@@ ave us ?
I cannot stop thinking of the sto@@ l@@ en money .

I tried to trans@@ late the senten@@ ce &quot; T@@ he cat s@@ ays &apos; me@@ o@@ w &apos; &quot; into five langu@@ ages , but n@@ one of the trans@@ l@@ ations were correct .
it won &apos;t take that long .

I thought there was a pos@@ si@@ bili@@ ty that Tom was going to break the contr@@ act .
we might need to help Tom .
he ag@@ re@@ ed to give us an inter@@ vie@@ w .
I don &apos;t know why I thought it would be differ@@ ent this time .

this is bad news .
there &apos;s no to@@ il@@ et pap@@ er !
I can &apos;t tell you what to do .
the patient fin@@ ally con@@ qu@@ ered his ill@@ ness .
you should &apos;ve told Tom that a long time ago .
they are am@@ ong us !
I know that you &apos;re s@@ mar@@ t .
I often go to the se@@ a .
what is her sho@@ e si@@ ze ?
I want to buy a shi@@ rt for my little brother .

in the early days people comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ated by smo@@ ke si@@ gn@@ als .
I have lo@@ ts of money .

why can &apos;t I love them both ?
did you know &quot; cre@@ du@@ l@@ ous &quot; is not in the dic@@ tion@@ ary ?
I would like to learn to speak English with confi@@ d@@ ence .

when are you going to ask her ?
water bo@@ ils at a tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure of 1@@ 00 de@@ gre@@ es c@@ enti@@ gr@@ ade .
that doesn &apos;t worry me at all .
I loo@@ ked , but I didn &apos;t see anything .
all of them say so , but I believe n@@ one of them .
the her@@ oin isn &apos;t a good thing , stay away from it !
I &apos;m cel@@ e@@ br@@ ating .
I can &apos;t remember where I par@@ ked the car .
wh@@ at@@ ever you do , don &apos;t s@@ mi@@ le .
it would be better for both of us not to see each other anymore .
no one could sol@@ ve the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le .
wom@@ en are ph@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ ally wea@@ k@@ er than m@@ en .
I feel like such an idi@@ ot .

would you like a little help ?
I knew you &apos;d know where to find Tom .
I &apos;m glad I lear@@ ned English .

I asked my teacher what I should do next .
English is my f@@ avo@@ rite sub@@ j@@ ect in high school .
it would be better if you work this af@@ ter@@ noon .
if for some reas@@ on that should happen , what would you do ?
Sami sle@@ pt in his t@@ ent .
the restaurant we went to wasn &apos;t as ex@@ pen@@ sive as I exp@@ ected it to be .
they appoin@@ ted him as a direc@@ tor .
almost everything has been im@@ pro@@ ved .
I really like this one .
we found one large fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ t and a couple of differ@@ ent si@@ ze sm@@ aller fo@@ ot@@ prin@@ ts .
do you plan to buy that car ?
does that make any sense ?
they were ta@@ ken pri@@ son@@ er .
what is the t@@ all@@ est m@@ oun@@ tain in Euro@@ pe ?
Tom lost his gl@@ asses some@@ where in the gar@@ d@@ en .
he has been to France .
you can take wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever road you like .
S@@ ally rec@@ all@@ ed the days when her grand@@ ma was str@@ ong and heal@@ th@@ y .
why don &apos;t you ask M@@ r W@@ hi@@ te ?
try to be more pun@@ ctu@@ al from now on .
when I run , I get sw@@ e@@ at@@ y .
I have to go .
have you ever had a lo@@ ver who was never in the way ?
I &apos;ve already f@@ illed out the for@@ m .
br@@ ing an um@@ br@@ el@@ la without for@@ getting .
I &apos;d pre@@ fer to di@@ e ra@@ ther than give up .
Tom doesn &apos;t like mat@@ h .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him to talk about his life in the U@@ n@@ ited S@@ t@@ ates .
she turned her eyes away .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll be f@@ ine .
where have you been up to now ?
you never have any dou@@ b@@ ts , do you ?
Tom bur@@ st out laugh@@ ing .
I can not aff@@ or@@ d to buy a used car .
we cau@@ ght him red @-@ hand@@ ed .
I &apos;m sorry I had to leave you alone .
I had nothing to do with that .
I never go out .
in about ten minutes , you &apos;ll find out more .
I am as@@ king you for pati@@ ence .
it &apos;ll be hard to find a re@@ pl@@ ac@@ ement for him .
it &apos;s cal@@ m .
she was h@@ it by a car .
Tom would &apos;ve made the same dec@@ ision I &apos;m ma@@ king if he were in my sho@@ es .
I have a large be@@ d@@ room .
let the cat out .
I fin@@ ally met her .
I &apos;ll go wh@@ er@@ ever you want me to go .
it is less cold today than it was yesterday .
there have been a lot of compl@@ ain@@ ts about the way Tom be@@ hav@@ es .
we &apos;re not invit@@ ed .
you need to fil@@ ter the out@@ put of this comm@@ and in order to dis@@ play only the l@@ ines with &quot; fo@@ o &quot; in@@ side .
he has a daughter who is very pretty .
don &apos;t th@@ row the ball n@@ ear the windo@@ ws .
the E@@ ar@@ th is like a ball with a large mag@@ n@@ et in@@ side .
that &apos;s just what I nee@@ ded .
promise me you won &apos;t tell her .
I don &apos;t care who we give it to .
we want fu@@ r@@ ther information .
I could har@@ d@@ ly end@@ ure the pain .
don &apos;t back away .
this doesn &apos;t look good .
I cau@@ ght a beautiful bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ ly .
French was the language of di@@ pl@@ om@@ ac@@ y .
I can &apos;t tell you how angry that makes me .
what do you love ? what do you hate ?
how much is your h@@ our@@ ly pay ?
how could I lie to you ?
he was a Fren@@ ch@@ man . I could tell by his acc@@ ent .
I will never understand .
we &apos;ll respon@@ d .
as my father and my grand@@ father have many si@@ bl@@ ings , there are a lot of k@@ ids in our family .
did you see him go out ?
Sami has been married six times .
my father does not eat much fru@@ it .
the ver@@ b &quot; to be &quot; has an ir@@ re@@ gu@@ l@@ ar con@@ ju@@ g@@ ation in all langu@@ ages .
do you want me to re@@ pe@@ at the question ?
do I have to go now ?
a home is more than a m@@ ere buil@@ ding .
have you already e@@ at@@ en ?
it &apos;s really aw@@ es@@ o@@ me .
he always ta@@ kes L@@ รฉ@@ a on his la@@ p to read her a story .
I don &apos;t go out much .
Tom is not a true w@@ arri@@ or .
Tom nee@@ ds lo@@ ts of cour@@ age and pers@@ ever@@ ance because he has to pay attention to so many things at the same time .
I &apos;m reading a letter .
it must &apos;ve cost a fort@@ une .
thank you for invit@@ ing me to dinner .
I want to know what you &apos;re thinking .
don &apos;t be afraid of the dog who bar@@ ks , but be afraid of the one who is sil@@ ent and w@@ ag@@ s its tai@@ l .
what did you just say ?
they make a great tea@@ m .
the se@@ par@@ ati@@ sts think that I &apos;m k@@ id@@ ding .
the bicy@@ cle is mine .
we think we &apos;ve found a way to help you .
I am ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job .
that &apos;s not what happened here .
I ate some pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
I use the Intern@@ et as a res@@ our@@ ce for my res@@ ear@@ ch .
he said he was poor .
she thin@@ ks about him all the time .
he has his own room .
I don &apos;t know who else to turn to for help .
this dr@@ aw@@ ing took me five minutes , but I took si@@ x@@ ty years to get there .
I don &apos;t want to live by your ru@@ les .
I didn &apos;t stop .
she took the news cal@@ m@@ ly .
how &apos;s everybody doing ?
we &apos;re was@@ ting time .
what did you get h@@ it with ?
car@@ s are ex@@ pen@@ sive .
they were not im@@ press@@ ed .
to tell the truth , I dro@@ ve my father &apos;s car without his per@@ mis@@ sion .
he is Japanese to the b@@ one .
we go@@ tt@@ a have all the d@@ at@@ a in there .
she doesn &apos;t want him to buy an ex@@ pen@@ sive en@@ gag@@ ement ring .
I think it &apos;s time for me to get my own place .
you know what you must do .
he is t@@ wi@@ ce as old as she is .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
is this what you were looking for ?
write in the d@@ ate yourself .
there is no hope .
cut that out !
I have to put my sho@@ es on .
Tom is an ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect , right ?
were you busy ?
I de@@ fe@@ ated the w@@ arri@@ or .
you are not the only one respon@@ sible for it , I am too .
I never wanted this .
I try to trav@@ el with only one su@@ it@@ c@@ ase .
you &apos;re was@@ ting both of our time .
early ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ers used the star@@ s for n@@ av@@ ig@@ ation .
his sal@@ ary is too low to sup@@ port his family on .
this is a very time @-@ con@@ su@@ ming t@@ ask .
your phone is r@@ in@@ g@@ ing again .
Tom wants to mar@@ ry Mary .
who asked you to do that ?
have a pie@@ ce of p@@ ie .
long , long ago , there lived an old man in a village .
let &apos;s walk a little f@@ as@@ ter .
I know exactly where I am .
my m@@ om bought me this to@@ y when I was ei@@ ght years old .
I hope we &apos;re not ma@@ king a hu@@ ge mist@@ ake .
brea@@ k@@ fast is ser@@ ved .
this is il@@ le@@ g@@ al .
I &apos;m not in the mo@@ od to go for a walk .
I &apos;d like to see that ring , please .
are you sure you want to leave without s@@ aying go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e ?
we man@@ ag@@ ed to swim ac@@ ro@@ ss the ri@@ ver .
Mary wants to bre@@ as@@ t@@ fe@@ ed her b@@ ab@@ y , but she &apos;s not ma@@ king enough milk .
who is he talking to ?
what &apos;s the best cu@@ re for lon@@ el@@ in@@ ess ?
would you mind spea@@ king more s@@ low@@ ly ?
do you want to stay here all night ?
Tom poin@@ ted out my mist@@ ake .
the p@@ a@@ tro@@ l@@ man mo@@ tion@@ ed me to pu@@ ll over .
I &apos;ll s@@ end you a pos@@ t@@ c@@ ard .
I &apos;d like to get you both to help me .
there &apos;s nothing there .
I know that you &apos;re very angry .
you should try to have fun .
I never thought I &apos;d see Tom again .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s easy .
it &apos;s against the la@@ w .
she has no less than ten children .
all that g@@ list@@ ers is not go@@ ld .
one of the gu@@ ar@@ ds is d@@ ead .
you o@@ we it to yourself to do it .
parents must pro@@ vi@@ de their children with pro@@ per food and clo@@ thing .
I just want you to know how sorry I am .
don &apos;t be@@ at about the bus@@ h .
would you like to sleep a little longer ?
you are suppos@@ ed to o@@ be@@ y the la@@ w .
wh@@ at@@ ever you do , don &apos;t p@@ ush that bu@@ tt@@ on .
I love the out@@ fit you &apos;re w@@ ear@@ ing .
are you acc@@ us@@ ing me of che@@ ating ?
you can &apos;t dri@@ ve now . you &apos;ve been drin@@ king .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t res@@ ist .
&quot; does she have a dog ? &quot; &quot; no , she doesn &apos;t . &quot;
Tom wanted to see him .
this house is mine .
we were very careful .
I think it &apos;s O@@ K .
fol@@ low your heart , for it never li@@ es .
do you have any small change ?
don &apos;t st@@ are at me like that .
I wanted your opinion .
my father , who is now working in Americ@@ a , w@@ ro@@ te us a letter last week .
why did you come home so late ?
the contr@@ act is in the b@@ a@@ g , so let &apos;s go out and cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate .
accor@@ ding to fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , c@@ ats have n@@ ine lives .
he was spea@@ king .
I &apos;m not going to S@@ pain on ho@@ li@@ day .
Tom didn &apos;t know wh@@ e@@ ther he should do that or not .
this bro@@ ken v@@ ase cannot be re@@ p@@ ai@@ red .
we must have fai@@ th in the pres@@ i@@ dent .
how did you get into our room ?
we had to l@@ ess@@ en the imp@@ act of the er@@ r@@ ati@@ c sup@@ p@@ li@@ es .
he has not wri@@ tten to them for a long time .
I can understand what she is s@@ aying .
do wh@@ at@@ ever you like .
I was in all day .
it looks like a du@@ ck .
we cannot ru@@ le out the pos@@ si@@ bili@@ ty that ci@@ v@@ il w@@ ar will break out in that country .
I called him , but a girl answ@@ ered the phone .
Tom was watching him so@@ w sal@@ ad .
if you don &apos;t want me to go , I won &apos;t .
&quot; should I m@@ ea@@ sure the fl@@ our out ? &quot; &quot; you can ey@@ eb@@ all it if you want . &quot;

in c@@ ase of rain , the ath@@ le@@ tic meeting will be called off .
there is a cat .
be careful !
I love your son .

W@@ i@@ pe your t@@ ears .
it took me more than two hours to trans@@ late a few p@@ ages of English .
it &apos;s getting har@@ der for me to conc@@ entr@@ ate .
I &apos;m not cre@@ ative .
the books were so v@@ al@@ u@@ able that they were hand@@ led with the gre@@ at@@ est care .
they have lost a lot .
looks like we bar@@ ked up the wrong t@@ ree .
I have questions .
I didn &apos;t start all this .
I wish you could have come with me .
as a matter of fac@@ t , all great dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ers have been regar@@ ded as dre@@ am@@ ers .
thank you , I &apos;d like to stay in your house .
I promise that you won &apos;t be dis@@ appoin@@ ted .
can you dri@@ ve man@@ u@@ al ?
Tom seems very happy .
show me how to do that .
I mess@@ ed up .
I think I did something wrong .
Tom has already told Mary not to do that anymore .
he &apos;s a ch@@ ain smo@@ k@@ er .
P@@ eas@@ ants often have a secon@@ d@@ ary acti@@ v@@ ity to au@@ g@@ ment their in@@ come .
our pass@@ por@@ ts were can@@ cel@@ led .
me@@ dic@@ ine should be out of the way of children .
that word des@@ cri@@ bes it per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly .
he works for her .
help me out here .
where do you live in T@@ ur@@ key ?
why are you so c@@ lu@@ m@@ s@@ y ?

I have an um@@ br@@ el@@ la in my car .
wh@@ ose sho@@ es are these ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat be@@ ef .
do you know where he went ?
the b@@ ear is big .
I &apos;ll take your su@@ it@@ c@@ ase to your room , sir .
it &apos;s as you say .
the door nee@@ ds another co@@ at of pain@@ t .
I told you so !

could you please tell me again how many times you &apos;ve been here ?
if you wanted to im@@ pro@@ ve your S@@ pan@@ ish , you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have come to C@@ hi@@ le .
I know you like to trav@@ el .
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong .
when did he come here ?
I &apos;ll keep this c@@ ake for myself .
don &apos;t talk back to me like that .
this summer we &apos;ll go to the m@@ oun@@ t@@ ains and to the se@@ a .
as far as I know , he has never come on time .
he av@@ eng@@ ed the mu@@ r@@ der of his father .
my watch lo@@ ses ten minutes a day .
he is compl@@ et@@ ely bes@@ ot@@ ted with her .
let &apos;s do it your way .
it &apos;s so hot out@@ side that I want to spend all day in my air con@@ di@@ tion@@ ed house .
I was f@@ al@@ sel@@ y acc@@ used .
he didn &apos;t know how to ex@@ pr@@ ess himself .
Tom said Mary was happy .
someone was killed .
she will make us a nice dinner .
you &apos;re sure there &apos;s no way ?
I heard them coming .
I had a h@@ ea@@ d@@ ache , so I couldn &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s a@@ head of s@@ che@@ du@@ le .
Tom r@@ ar@@ ely hu@@ gs Mary anymore .
she didn &apos;t want him to play po@@ k@@ er .
when we look at other pl@@ ac@@ es in the uni@@ ver@@ se , it could very well be that photo@@ sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic life is the exc@@ ep@@ tion .
it &apos;s true that it would be eas@@ ier for students if there were only one sin@@ gle S@@ pan@@ ish di@@ al@@ ect , but that &apos;s quite far from being the c@@ ase .
I won &apos;t run away like a co@@ ward .
where &apos;s your daughter ?
you must take your parents advice seri@@ ous@@ ly .
I &apos;ll get there before you .
he came to meet me yesterday af@@ ter@@ noon .
I haven &apos;t told the k@@ ids yet that we &apos;re getting di@@ v@@ or@@ ced .

I could really make things hard for you , you know .
you &apos;ve ris@@ ked enough .
you knew that already , didn &apos;t you ?
I gave my brother a dic@@ tion@@ ary .

she &apos;s well st@@ ac@@ ked .
Sami thin@@ ks he did very well in the ex@@ am .
I didn &apos;t study at all yesterday .

one of my plea@@ sures is watching TV .
we need to get out of here .

Tom apo@@ logi@@ zed .
I just wanted to see if I could do it .
the fo@@ g is gro@@ wing th@@ ick@@ er .

I &apos;m a lu@@ cky man .
E@@ ar@@ ning our cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers confi@@ d@@ ence and resp@@ ect is this fir@@ m &apos;s objec@@ tive .
what will the nei@@ gh@@ b@@ ors think ?
you can &apos;t pro@@ ve a thing .
this school sup@@ p@@ li@@ es students with t@@ ex@@ t@@ books .
his d@@ el@@ ay of coming here on time is du@@ e to a tr@@ aff@@ ic accident .
we need a str@@ at@@ e@@ g@@ y .

A@@ chi@@ ev@@ ing a nice w@@ el@@ d b@@ ead is not with@@ in everyone &apos;s re@@ ac@@ h !

she hand@@ ed me a pos@@ t@@ c@@ ard .
I just have to do something .
nobody in@@ sul@@ ts my country .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
I think you would like it here .
his answer was f@@ av@@ or@@ able .
how many col@@ ours are there ?
the language of fri@@ end@@ shi@@ p is not words but me@@ an@@ ings .
if you want my help , you &apos;ll have to ask for it .

inst@@ ead of going to school , he st@@ ayed at home .
I wish you were here with me now .
Tom asked me for more money than he really nee@@ ded .
I must br@@ ush up my English .

W@@ ho@@ ever wants it may take it .
I guess it &apos;s time to go .
you &apos;re just a co@@ ward .
pain@@ ting is another thing I can do fai@@ r@@ ly well .
D@@ is@@ ti@@ ll@@ ed water has no t@@ as@@ te .
there are two c@@ ats sleep@@ ing on the bed .
you have to promise not to tell anyone .
I am interested in music .
it &apos;s a was@@ te of time and money .
I &apos;ll try to get a l@@ ay of the l@@ and before I start con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ting .
I was having brea@@ k@@ fast when I saw the fi@@ re in the gar@@ d@@ en .

a st@@ ar sh@@ ines on the h@@ our of our meeting .
here we took the bo@@ at for Al@@ as@@ k@@ a .
she has a son and two daugh@@ ters .
I didn &apos;t want to do this in the first place .
I have always felt that you always knew that Sami was your son .
we all have arrived .
I &apos;m on cr@@ u@@ t@@ ches for the next mon@@ th .
I cannot stop the b@@ le@@ e@@ ding .
he is always trying to do the im@@ possible .
don &apos;t comp@@ lic@@ ate the problem by rais@@ ing new is@@ su@@ es .

wom@@ en today drink as much as m@@ en .
they had once hel@@ ped each other .
the pri@@ ce of go@@ ld flu@@ ctu@@ ates d@@ ai@@ ly .
he is nothing but a po@@ et .
that can happen .
I &apos;ve decided to do the same thing .
he dev@@ el@@ op@@ ed his own the@@ ory .
how are you doing ? I haven &apos;t seen you in ages !
I boo@@ k@@ mar@@ ked this we@@ b@@ si@@ te .
why is she so popul@@ ar ?
did you k@@ ill Tom ?
she &apos;s not a vir@@ g@@ in anymore .
you li@@ ed to me , didn &apos;t you ?
tell me again where you live .
is that correct ?
she decided to mar@@ ry him .
she &apos;s lear@@ ning to swim .
I can &apos;t come and see you every day .
I &apos;ll close the door .
the wom@@ en play tennis .
which came first , the ch@@ ic@@ ken or the e@@ g@@ g ?
she pass@@ ed away yesterday af@@ ter@@ noon .
I &apos;m going to take care of it for you .
now go have fun .
he married my cou@@ s@@ in .
I &apos;m really f@@ ed up with this he@@ at .
Tom went to sleep three hours ago .
she was talking all the time .
there are s@@ even days in a week .
what &apos;s that t@@ all buil@@ ding ?
are those your daugh@@ ters ?
I don &apos;t want to miss my train .
I don &apos;t want to take a walk now .
we don &apos;t know what they want to use it for .
eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers try to take ad@@ v@@ antage of nat@@ ure ra@@ ther than try to understand it .
do you work here ?
I saw l@@ and in the dist@@ ance .

the pri@@ son@@ er es@@ cap@@ ed under co@@ ver of night .
could you , please , l@@ end me your car tomorrow ?
they &apos;re right behind you .
we pres@@ ent@@ ed a watch to him .
I want to live in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il .
I think Tom is cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous .
he hi@@ des his head in the s@@ and , like an o@@ st@@ rich .
I don &apos;t think I have the experi@@ ence necess@@ ary for that job .
she got a pres@@ ent from her bo@@ y@@ friend .
can you turn off the light ?
M@@ r W@@ hi@@ te made a few comm@@ ents on my s@@ pe@@ ec@@ h .
he is num@@ b@@ ered am@@ ong the gre@@ at@@ est scienti@@ sts in the world .
could you try to be a little less sel@@ fish for a change ?
you won &apos;t be shot .
he has money .
we had lun@@ ch ear@@ li@@ er than usu@@ al and went out at tw@@ el@@ ve thir@@ ty .
they were pl@@ ain@@ ly dres@@ sed .
it &apos;s yours if you want it .
I think it &apos;s danger@@ ous to cli@@ m@@ b that m@@ oun@@ tain alone .
are you having dinner ?
why don &apos;t you believe them ?
b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its of cour@@ se should exc@@ e@@ ed the co@@ sts .
they were att@@ ac@@ ked .
I pro@@ t@@ est !
is any@@ body in there ?
the de@@ f@@ end@@ ant is being acc@@ used of a li@@ t@@ any of cri@@ min@@ al and ci@@ v@@ il off@@ en@@ ses .
I thought Tom had ag@@ re@@ ed to do the job .
what should I eat ?
it &apos;s in the fri@@ d@@ ge .
he &apos;s not going to visit you tomorrow .
he may not be able to come .
the doctor se@@ i@@ zed the patient &apos;s hand and said : &quot; so how do we feel today ? &quot;
where are you from ?
you &apos;ve never seen a gen@@ u@@ ine di@@ am@@ on@@ d .
she came into the room .
she fol@@ low@@ ed me into the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en and pic@@ ked up a k@@ ni@@ fe .
I don &apos;t know anything about that .
he is pl@@ eas@@ ed with his work .
it beg@@ an to rain before I got home .
there are more B@@ u@@ dd@@ hi@@ sts in Ger@@ many today than people who know how to make a good cho@@ co@@ late c@@ ake .
I didn &apos;t res@@ ist the pres@@ sure they for@@ ced on me .

I have to go to the sal@@ on and get my ro@@ ot tou@@ ched up .

L@@ on@@ don is large , com@@ par@@ ed with Paris .
I &apos;m going out .

why didn &apos;t No@@ a@@ h sw@@ at those two mo@@ s@@ quit@@ o@@ es ?
I didn &apos;t cat@@ ch what he said .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary lives .
Tom bought an ex@@ pen@@ sive Ch@@ rist@@ m@@ as pres@@ ent for himself .
he almost never went there .
what did you want to show us ?
don &apos;t try to be a her@@ o .
in his face !
I &apos;m one of you .
I don &apos;t want to be any more bur@@ d@@ en to my parents .
are you out of your mind ?
I &apos;m in@@ side .

he told me his life &apos;s story .
Tom has just finished e@@ ating dinner .
I need to know everything that you know about Tom .
not all tea@@ ch@@ ers be@@ have like that .
I think it will be sun@@ ny tomorrow .

we play@@ ed ch@@ ess .
Sami decided to turn a bl@@ ind ey@@ e to the truth .
Tom had a difficult job .
that has nothing to do with it .
would you like to try it again ?
life is too shor@@ t , really !
he fai@@ led to come yesterday .
Tom wants to be a di@@ pl@@ om@@ at .
he went there , never to re@@ turn .
I conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated it .
I don &apos;t want to tell him .
what kind of mist@@ a@@ kes did you make ?
I wasn &apos;t the one dri@@ ving the car .
Tom p@@ at@@ ted me on the back and con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ated me .
P@@ et@@ er was an al@@ tru@@ is@@ tic vi@@ de@@ o game play@@ er ; he would give it@@ ems to people who nee@@ ded them , ra@@ ther than sel@@ ling them for pers@@ on@@ al prof@@ it .

it is about time you married .
the milk &apos;s a bit off .
my h@@ us@@ b@@ and is in j@@ ai@@ l .
if I knew his ad@@ dress , I would get in tou@@ ch with him right away .
Tom found something .
I had an um@@ br@@ el@@ la with me but my friend did not .
I can &apos;t fi@@ x the se@@ at .
he igno@@ red her advice .
there was something off in Sami &apos;s life .

did you miss me ?
that &apos;s the har@@ d@@ est part .
I don &apos;t know for cert@@ ain .
what time do you turn off the li@@ gh@@ ts ?
I have to say I en@@ v@@ y you .
his trou@@ bles are not over .
I &apos;m not sure what it was , but it s@@ oun@@ ded like a g@@ un@@ shot .
we have a d@@ ea@@ d@@ l@@ ine .
is there some@@ where in Euro@@ pe you &apos;d like to visit ?
he &apos;s a bi@@ got .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
he saw in her eyes that she still lo@@ ved him and hope ar@@ ose in@@ side him .
I don &apos;t even know how old Tom is .
I s@@ lic@@ ed the s@@ and@@ w@@ ich di@@ ag@@ on@@ ally .
she should have k@@ ept her mou@@ th sh@@ ut .
I think love does not ex@@ ist .
I guess my lu@@ ck just r@@ an out .

the dec@@ ision is still not de@@ fin@@ ite .
it seems she is over thir@@ ty years old .
is your father a doctor ?
I &apos;ve asked you re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ d@@ ly to do that .
the music c@@ arried me back to my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od .

I had to go back .
nobody sup@@ por@@ ted my country .
I &apos;ll tell her where I went .
I just did it .
who are you sel@@ ling your car to ?
she spea@@ ks English as if she were a n@@ ative spea@@ k@@ er .
I never thought I &apos;d be this busy .
I don &apos;t like both of you going to such a place .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary wants to live .
I &apos;m not happy with my looks .
I had to work over@@ time yesterday .
it &apos;ll be us three : you , me , and An@@ ne .
they acc@@ used him of telling a lie .
I &apos;m sorry if I s@@ n@@ app@@ ed at you .
you don &apos;t have to get up so early .
last week five students were ab@@ sent from class .
Sami sp@@ illed his drink in the store .
you don &apos;t have what it ta@@ kes to be a l@@ ea@@ der .
I don &apos;t like feel@@ ing so po@@ w@@ er@@ less .
nothing makes Tom happy .
Tom was late for dinner .
I am glad that the matter was s@@ et@@ t@@ led am@@ ic@@ ab@@ ly .

this concer@@ t was aw@@ es@@ o@@ me .
what is life without the radi@@ ance of love ?
this is the un@@ for@@ get@@ table place where we met each other for the first time .
it is , I think , an in@@ dis@@ pu@@ table fac@@ t that Americ@@ ans are , as Americ@@ ans , the most self @-@ con@@ sci@@ ous people in the world , and the most ad@@ dic@@ ted to the beli@@ ef that the other n@@ ations of the ear@@ th are in a con@@ sp@@ ir@@ ac@@ y to under@@ v@@ al@@ ue them .

nobody car@@ es for me .
there is a tax@@ i stand n@@ ear the station .
if C@@ le@@ op@@ a@@ tr@@ a &apos;s no@@ se had been shor@@ ter , the hi@@ story of the world would be differ@@ ent .
his room was small but cle@@ an , and the food was good .
his sle@@ ev@@ e tou@@ ched the gre@@ as@@ y p@@ an .
it &apos;s a sac@@ red right .
I think Tom can do that .
they are all very happy .
why don &apos;t you understand ?
I have children .
S@@ m@@ ith has sp@@ ent years stu@@ d@@ ying the eff@@ ec@@ ts of sleep and sleep lo@@ ss on m@@ em@@ ory and lear@@ ning .
I did everything I could do .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll have time to do it .

H@@ er@@ o@@ ing is one of the shor@@ t@@ est @-@ lived prof@@ es@@ si@@ ons there is .
the milk is s@@ our .
does anyone speak English ?
he ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ed to us for help .
why did you let me sleep so late ?
it may be im@@ possible to get a compl@@ et@@ ely er@@ ro@@ r @-@ free cor@@ p@@ us du@@ e to the nat@@ ure of this kind of coll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative effor@@ t . H@@ o@@ w@@ ever , if we en@@ cour@@ age m@@ em@@ b@@ ers to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te senten@@ ces in their own langu@@ ages ra@@ ther than experi@@ ment in langu@@ ages they are lear@@ ning , we might be able to min@@ im@@ i@@ ze er@@ r@@ ors .
that is the wor@@ st thing you can do !
has he got any experi@@ ence of f@@ ar@@ ming ?
Tom knows the city very well .
you could &apos;ve ru@@ in@@ ed everything .

I &apos;m done with you .

how did you get over the difficul@@ ty ?
when did you start wri@@ ting son@@ gs ?

I like gar@@ li@@ c .

Tom inst@@ ant@@ ly fell in love with Mary .

I did not be@@ tr@@ ay you .
is he afraid of death ?
they were just g@@ am@@ bl@@ ing .

she s@@ car@@ ed the cat away .
bar@@ king do@@ gs never bi@@ te .
may I drink al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ?
you did well not to fol@@ low his advice .
you don &apos;t have to think you aren &apos;t going to make it just because others have fai@@ led .
his idea looks a lot like mine .
you &apos;ll be the first to know .
Tom just told his wife that he was leav@@ ing her .
he lived alone in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
Tom wants to jo@@ in our c@@ lu@@ b .
this is ir@@ re@@ gu@@ l@@ ar .
that &apos;s why I came back so soon .
not being wat@@ ch@@ ful , the dri@@ ver fai@@ led to stop in time .

you don &apos;t need to worry about wi@@ re@@ t@@ app@@ ing .
no so@@ on@@ er had he met his family than he bur@@ st into t@@ ears .

no one could make the prin@@ c@@ ess l@@ au@@ gh .
there is in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ent light to take pic@@ tures .
I knew Tom was a bit cr@@ azy .
I don &apos;t like your s@@ mi@@ le .
he made up his mind to mar@@ ry K@@ ath@@ y .
why did you gu@@ ys break up ?
they never drink be@@ er .

it was the first time that I vis@@ ited the mus@@ eu@@ m .

I don &apos;t feel like going out .
he has pl@@ ans .
his secre@@ t@@ ary seems to know the truth .
in order to get the so@@ il ready for plan@@ ting you must plo@@ w it .
how can you conc@@ entr@@ ate ?
you should read books b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ici@@ al to you .
I would like to have a cu@@ p of coffee .
your trou@@ bles are just beg@@ in@@ ning .
she is very photo@@ gen@@ ic .
this is very interes@@ ting .
do you really want to put your life in her hands ?
he can &apos;t be ill .

he found his m@@ as@@ ter .
I b@@ le@@ ed eas@@ ily when I am cut .
I am not e@@ ating my sal@@ ad , because I pre@@ fer cho@@ co@@ late .

you ought to have told me that before .
we are leav@@ ing this country for good .
I wanted to let you know about that , but Tom told me not to say anything .
this car is very e@@ con@@ om@@ ic@@ al on g@@ as .
I &apos;m sorry if I em@@ barrass@@ ed you .
I just don &apos;t want you to get hurt .

would you like a little help ?
we can &apos;t do it .
they chose him as their re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative .
I think we &apos;d better take a break .
he became a pian@@ ist .
the rain has let up , so we can beg@@ in .
we had to stop .
just pre@@ ten@@ d I &apos;m not here .
we must be ready for anything .
I knew then that I was right .
please cho@@ ose a str@@ on@@ ger pass@@ word .

he was cau@@ ght with his p@@ ants down .
a@@ part from my sister , my family doesn &apos;t watch TV .
they spo@@ ke bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly .
where do you want to sleep tonight ?
I said nothing about the matter .
I hur@@ ri@@ ed so as not to miss the train .
I was so afraid that no one would ask me to dance .
time pass@@ es , and it tur@@ n@@ s the wh@@ e@@ el of life as water does that of a m@@ ill .
which way is the che@@ ese sh@@ el@@ f ?
if I told you , you wouldn &apos;t understand .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like the same kind of music .
she can &apos;t find her k@@ ey@@ s .
what do you learn English for ?
Tom is a bit old , but not too u@@ g@@ ly .
Tom couldn &apos;t find the bus stop .
if you see Tom , please tell him for me .
I hope you were able to buy everything you need .
I had a really great time with your family .
this man is in@@ comp@@ et@@ ent .
fl@@ ying a k@@ ite can be danger@@ ous .

I told you not to talk about the matter in her pres@@ ence .
we &apos;ll visit you tomorrow .
I &apos;m glad we didn &apos;t go there because there were some lo@@ c@@ ali@@ zed heav@@ y rain sho@@ w@@ ers .
her words were like those of an ang@@ el .
I have to dress up .
the sho@@ wer doesn &apos;t work .
we don &apos;t say that anymore .

I didn &apos;t know they were d@@ ating .
one must wait for the res@@ i@@ du@@ als to con@@ ver@@ ge before being able to use the si@@ mu@@ l@@ ation &apos;s res@@ ul@@ ts .
they &apos;re co@@ o@@ king now .
I can &apos;t live without a TV .

my father used to eat at this restaurant .
we should tell Tom the truth .
are you a poli@@ c@@ em@@ an ?

we used to play mus@@ ic@@ al ch@@ ai@@ rs in el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school .
B@@ ar@@ bar@@ a re@@ g@@ al@@ ed us with am@@ az@@ ing sto@@ ri@@ es about her trip to T@@ i@@ b@@ et .
where do you get off telling me that ?
can you pay me in ad@@ v@@ ance ?
&quot; are you seri@@ ous ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m ab@@ solu@@ tel@@ y seri@@ ous . &quot;
I fi@@ red the g@@ un .
Oh you poor little thing .
he ju@@ m@@ ped into the water .
I &apos;ve finished .
I want you to keep your promise .
Tom married an ol@@ der woman .
every mo@@ v@@ ement is pain@@ ful .
she li@@ ked everything about him .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong with her .
I did war@@ n you .
that &apos;s my car .
I &apos;m not going to do that until Mon@@ day .
I me@@ ant to call her , but I for@@ got to .
you don &apos;t look very str@@ ong .
I compl@@ et@@ ely ap@@ pro@@ ve of this .
Tom took part in the summer f@@ es@@ ti@@ v@@ al .
they cau@@ ght Tom .
she was ab@@ sent from school because she was sick .
everybody wants per@@ man@@ ent p@@ ea@@ ce .
her sor@@ row was only appar@@ ent .
J@@ ane looks very p@@ ale .
Tom comm@@ it@@ ted su@@ ici@@ de in pri@@ son .
Tom is a m@@ ember of the S@@ W@@ A@@ T tea@@ m .
they had to change their s@@ che@@ du@@ le because the train arrived late .
&quot; qui@@ et , &quot; he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed .
you see@@ m to know everything .
in two mo@@ ves , K@@ as@@ par@@ o@@ v will ch@@ ec@@ k the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ger .
I &apos;m glad to be home .
I thought it would be a good idea to get back in tou@@ ch with Japanese cul@@ ture and hi@@ story .
she loo@@ ked trou@@ bl@@ ed by the news .
what you &apos;re doing makes me ner@@ vous .
do you mind much ?
it is cl@@ ou@@ dy now .
the show star@@ ts at noon .
I can &apos;t go to the restaurant with you tonight .
I &apos;m not at work today .
you &apos;re very under@@ stand@@ ing .
French is my f@@ avo@@ rite language .
I think that she &apos;s hi@@ ding something .
don &apos;t leave me yet , Tom .
you have to try again .
it won &apos;t be long before they get married .
no one could see us .
we &apos;re ready now .
she th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed to set our house on fi@@ re .
the wh@@ ale is well known to be the lar@@ g@@ est m@@ am@@ mal .
that &apos;s true for every day exc@@ ept one .
Sami knows this ho@@ od like the back of his hand .
the ris@@ ks are too great .
S@@ te@@ ph@@ en C@@ ol@@ b@@ er@@ t is a pretty cr@@ azy gu@@ y .
give it back to me .
M@@ r S@@ m@@ ith tea@@ ches me English .
the el@@ ev@@ at@@ or seems to be out of order .
I sometimes have a hard time cho@@ o@@ sing wh@@ e@@ ther I should list@@ en to reas@@ on or my feel@@ ings .
do you want a few more minutes ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to was@@ h my car .
you should get that so@@ f@@ a reu@@ pho@@ l@@ st@@ ered .
the old woman is too wea@@ k to get out of bed .
even if it co@@ sts 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 y@@ en , I must buy the dic@@ tion@@ ary .
he is so old that he cannot walk qu@@ ick@@ ly .
please wait a moment .
pre@@ p@@ are yourself .
they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted they were s@@ car@@ ed .
I was going to go .
I thought you did that last week .
I really enjo@@ y sp@@ end@@ ing time with you .
I did all the work myself .
does he go to school by bus ?
there are too many of them .
we have to ask everybody this .
he got his d@@ and@@ er up .
it &apos;s a fru@@ it .
I &apos;m l@@ ying on the gr@@ ass .
you &apos;ve got to answer the question .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe in life after death .
I &apos;m tired of e@@ ating at the school caf@@ et@@ er@@ ia .
summer is coming to an end .
will you leave a mess@@ age ?
how lon@@ ely and hel@@ pl@@ ess she must feel left all by her@@ self !
as the first p@@ ack em@@ erg@@ es , the spec@@ t@@ at@@ ors take pic@@ tures with their cam@@ er@@ as and mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones .
why are you even here ?
I don &apos;t have anything else to do but wait for you .
my mother told me I nee@@ ded to eat less c@@ and@@ y .
I didn &apos;t s@@ cre@@ am .
I guess what I &apos;ve said isn &apos;t all that clear , but that &apos;s the only way I can ex@@ pl@@ ain it .
she will be able to answer your question .
how long have you been here for ?
there are many people trying to buy h@@ ou@@ ses .
it &apos;s in the gar@@ age .
you talk really fast .
that &apos;s not really a so@@ lution .
he &apos;s g@@ one into hi@@ ding .
M@@ r B@@ ro@@ wn is our fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al ad@@ vis@@ er .
I am an arti@@ st .
you should buy her new to@@ ys .
I had a hun@@ ch you would do that .
he &apos;s tri@@ p@@ ping b@@ all@@ s .
she is nothing to him .
J@@ u@@ li@@ an w@@ ears r@@ ound gl@@ asses like John L@@ enn@@ on &apos;s .
did you get fi@@ red from your last job ?
I like f@@ un@@ ny gu@@ ys .
I usu@@ ally get up at ei@@ ght .
there is a big par@@ k n@@ ear my school .
this des@@ k has lost one of its le@@ gs .
we have a few questions for you .
I will go even if it r@@ ains .
is it possible to det@@ er@@ mine the di@@ am@@ et@@ er from the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ fer@@ ence ?
do you plan to work until 10 : 00 ?
and on sun@@ ny days all the pi@@ ge@@ ons f@@ le@@ w home .
are you feel@@ ing O@@ K ?
Sami res@@ em@@ bles the su@@ sp@@ ect .

we believe in a better world .
is she still sin@@ gle ?
I didn &apos;t enjo@@ y the party at all .
she aim@@ ed at the tar@@ get .
we like her .
we &apos;re all after the same thing .
it &apos;s getting dar@@ k out@@ side .
I can &apos;t read A@@ r@@ ab@@ ic s@@ cri@@ pt .
they h@@ ated Tom .
I can &apos;t do it alone . I need your help .
I don &apos;t ag@@ ree with the the@@ ory that one should learn L@@ ati@@ n in order to better understand English .
I &apos;m being seri@@ ous !
you alone can do it , but you can &apos;t do it alone .
you don &apos;t want to know .
what do you think this is made of ?
I need to ask a few questions .
I need pro@@ of .
Tom doesn &apos;t sing very well .
please pic@@ k me up by car in fr@@ ont of the ho@@ tel .
who gave you your n@@ ick@@ name ?
under nor@@ mal con@@ di@@ tions , the bo@@ il@@ ing point of water is 1@@ 00 de@@ gre@@ es C@@ el@@ si@@ us .
we &apos;re doing well .
I don &apos;t know what to do here .
you took my ap@@ petite away .
this is the first time that I &apos;ve e@@ at@@ en in an I@@ tal@@ i@@ an pi@@ z@@ z@@ er@@ ia .
no one can den@@ y the fac@@ t .
ab@@ o@@ ve all things , we must not be sel@@ fish .
I have difficul@@ ty conc@@ entr@@ ating .
he is always d@@ w@@ el@@ ling on the plea@@ sures of the past .
I &apos;ll stay in@@ vol@@ ved .
this happened pri@@ or to rec@@ e@@ iv@@ ing your letter .
Tom likes te@@ ch@@ no@@ log@@ y .
what do you think he did ?
the pl@@ ant is b@@ lu@@ e .
we &apos;re getting out of here .
the go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment is re@@ des@@ ig@@ ning the cu@@ r@@ ren@@ c@@ y to try and cut down on coun@@ ter@@ fe@@ it@@ ing .
ac@@ id rain is not a nat@@ ur@@ al ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
we should pres@@ er@@ ve the beauti@@ es of the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
I can get us there more qu@@ ick@@ ly .
I don &apos;t think Tom can play the tru@@ m@@ p@@ et .
I think that fac@@ t is very important .
I don &apos;t know what I o@@ we you .
the less we think , the more we talk .
she &apos;s waiting for you at home .
I can &apos;t find anything .
I &apos;ll be there at 2 : 30 .
car@@ ry these books back to the boo@@ k@@ sh@@ el@@ f .
have a nice trip .
the train is leav@@ ing right away .
look , I don &apos;t want to lo@@ se my job .
you like c@@ ats , don &apos;t you ?
that has nothing to do with this .
is this f@@ ake ?
my father always read@@ s the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er before brea@@ k@@ fast .
Tom told me he &apos;d already e@@ at@@ en .
I &apos;ll do wh@@ at@@ ever you want .
she pl@@ ays the flu@@ te .
they look so cu@@ te together .
Tom wi@@ ped his gl@@ asses .
it really h@@ its the n@@ ai@@ l on the head .
she has inter@@ n@@ ation@@ al ren@@ own as a pain@@ ter .
I saw Tom s@@ li@@ p and f@@ all .
take your co@@ at off and make yourself at home .
a man &apos;s wor@@ th li@@ es not so much in what he has as in what he is .
I am aw@@ k@@ ward with num@@ b@@ ers .
do you have any idea who did this ?
I buil@@ t this do@@ gh@@ ouse by myself .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to the concer@@ t because he had to work .
he &apos;s bro@@ ke .
she is far from hon@@ est .
there are good gr@@ oun@@ ds for the vie@@ w that Paris was the s@@ cen@@ e of f@@ re@@ qu@@ ent ri@@ o@@ ts even before the re@@ vo@@ lution of 1@@ 7@@ 8@@ 9 .
he gave me a bri@@ ef out@@ l@@ ine of the plan .
if I were you , I would ignore it .
there are four se@@ as@@ ons in this country .
I want a don@@ ut .
I &apos;m in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ ly tired .
Tom has been be@@ having o@@ dd@@ ly .
do you want him to know about it ?
they won the sil@@ ver me@@ d@@ al .
everyone looks wor@@ ri@@ ed .
I obj@@ ect to her going there alone .
you &apos;re almost right .
are you going to tell him ?
you &apos;re the only one who wants to do that , aren &apos;t you ?
tell Tom I &apos;ll be there as soon as I can .
I have the best mother in the world !
we call a s@@ and@@ w@@ ich &quot; B@@ u@@ t@@ ter@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
many young people are out of work in the country .
I wish you had come with us .
this l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory is where we study every day .
I like these h@@ ats .
we &apos;ll dec@@ ide l@@ ater .
last win@@ ter , I went sk@@ i@@ ing in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
he said that he had a lot of money .
Sami wasn &apos;t in love with Layla .
this so@@ f@@ a can se@@ at three people eas@@ ily .
keep that thing away from me .
Sami has had a hard day .
don &apos;t exp@@ ect anyone to help you .
is the dog swimming ?
please pre@@ p@@ are for the trip .
I think Tom is a nice name .
I don &apos;t know who did that .
I write everything down ; I feel un@@ easy without my no@@ te@@ book .
that makes things clear .
you are good .
I don &apos;t see much cho@@ ice .
I just don &apos;t want to see you get hurt .
are you married or sin@@ gle ? do you live alone or are you in a rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p ?
the sk@@ y is clear . not a cl@@ ou@@ d in si@@ ght .
I &apos;m not st@@ op@@ ping you .
P@@ ee@@ ing s@@ it@@ ting down is not all that bad .
ch@@ ec@@ k these out .
is he kind to you ?
we always have enough time if we use it correc@@ tly .
Tom is as t@@ all as any student in his class is .
as yet , everything has been going well .
guess what happened to me .
your future beg@@ ins today .
I think it &apos;s danger@@ ous for children to swim in this l@@ ake .
everybody knows his name .
your sister &apos;s sleep@@ ing .
you &apos;ve bought more st@@ am@@ ps than necess@@ ary .
an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous sp@@ ace station ori@@ b@@ it@@ ing around J@@ up@@ it@@ er over@@ loo@@ ked the r@@ ain@@ bo@@ w st@@ ri@@ p@@ es of the g@@ as gi@@ ant .
the in@@ ju@@ red were re@@ mo@@ ved from the s@@ cen@@ e .
the train is arriv@@ ing !
I &apos;ll pay you .
she was sick .
I have a co@@ at , but I have no h@@ at .
I know the cu@@ re for what ails you .
I just want everybody to live .
they are happy with the res@@ ul@@ t .
do not be sh@@ y . your pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is more or less correct .
the air was hu@@ mi@@ d and lu@@ k@@ e@@ war@@ m .
of cour@@ se , we believe you .
I want to meet with Tom .
it almost s@@ car@@ ed me not to see you on@@ l@@ ine for a whole day .
she is as fl@@ at as a p@@ anc@@ ake .
this arti@@ cle is more interes@@ ting than the pre@@ vi@@ ous one .
do you h@@ it your children ?
beau@@ ty pl@@ eas@@ es the eyes , k@@ in@@ d@@ ness en@@ ch@@ ants the sou@@ l .
our plan went wrong from the beg@@ in@@ ning .
I don &apos;t enjo@@ y tea@@ ching children to swim when their parents are around .
this is one of the reas@@ ons why I love Tatoeba .
do you still need te@@ a ?
a child should not get more sp@@ end@@ ing money than is necess@@ ary .
the pi@@ z@@ z@@ a is cold .
&quot; are you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; so I am . &quot;
I was surprised by his su@@ dd@@ en ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance .
no one could den@@ y this .
Tom r@@ an out of mat@@ ches so he couldn &apos;t light the fi@@ re .
I &apos;ve never been to a prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al bas@@ eb@@ all game .
Tom &apos;s in@@ no@@ cent .
everyone g@@ ath@@ ered together for the pic@@ ture .
I &apos;d like to get away from Boston for a few days .
Tom is j@@ e@@ al@@ ous .
please re@@ fer to the tou@@ ri@@ st information office .
don &apos;t leave the fr@@ ont door open .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be coming .
it was N@@ anc@@ y where M@@ a@@ x was suppos@@ ed to meet P@@ at@@ ri@@ ci@@ a .
Tom and Mary was@@ hed the di@@ sh@@ es together .
Tom is watching .
bes@@ i@@ des the rain , we experi@@ enc@@ ed heav@@ y win@@ ds .
he comes from a small but we@@ al@@ th@@ y town .
I am game !
Tom seems to be in love .
P@@ en@@ ance is one of the s@@ even sac@@ ram@@ ents .
he asked me if I wanted to go ab@@ road .
we want to leave .
I &apos;m sorry for re@@ pro@@ ach@@ ing you .
does Tom still r@@ ely on his parents ?
I don &apos;t believe it happened that way .
I &apos;m no friend of yours .
I just wanted cl@@ ari@@ fic@@ ation .
let &apos;s worry about that l@@ ater .
he hurt his fin@@ ger with a nee@@ d@@ le .
she did her best to res@@ cu@@ e him .
I figu@@ red out a way to make more money .
this job gi@@ ves me the hu@@ m@@ p .
I didn &apos;t tell you everything .
the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y came true .
I hate people who have feel@@ ings .
have a nice wee@@ k@@ end !
&quot; so , you &apos;ll go out with me if I don &apos;t have to re@@ pe@@ at a year ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care for &apos; what if &apos; sto@@ ri@@ es . &quot;
I &apos;ve got something better in mind .
not all gen@@ i@@ uses are eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers , but all eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers are gen@@ i@@ uses . the set of all eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers is th@@ us an , un@@ fort@@ un@@ at@@ ely pro@@ per , sub@@ set of all gen@@ i@@ uses .
I don &apos;t think anyone thin@@ ks you &apos;re cr@@ azy .
Tom igno@@ red our advice .
we will be done in at most an h@@ our .
I see her laugh@@ ing and jo@@ king with them .
he was star@@ ing at her c@@ leav@@ age .
we &apos;re finished already .
we &apos;re un@@ rel@@ ated .
it &apos;s mis@@ l@@ ea@@ ding .
the only one who can sol@@ ve this problem is you .

you &apos;re a ner@@ vous w@@ re@@ ck .
are you good at kee@@ ping secre@@ ts ?
try hard to ho@@ ld it ti@@ ght !
do you have any idea what you &apos;re s@@ aying ?
you don &apos;t s@@ ound enti@@ r@@ ely con@@ vin@@ ced .
the boy is afraid to go to bed in the dar@@ k .
I believe it to be he .
you aren &apos;t looking .
are you lost ?
Tom put on his co@@ at and left .
it &apos;s a qu@@ ar@@ ter to two .
can I say it al@@ ou@@ d ?
she was on the s@@ cen@@ e of the cri@@ me .
it makes no fu@@ c@@ king sense .
his eyes were sm@@ il@@ ing behind his gl@@ asses .
miss S@@ a@@ to is the pres@@ i@@ dent &apos;s new secre@@ t@@ ary .
Tom doesn &apos;t take very good care of his children .
I &apos;m in bed .

please make five co@@ pi@@ es of this do@@ cu@@ ment .
do you have your p@@ ill@@ s ?

he h@@ it me t@@ wi@@ ce .
help me , please .
I &apos;ve never go@@ tten a s@@ pe@@ e@@ ding ti@@ cket .
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
a fish l@@ ea@@ ped out of the water .
I think we &apos;re going to stay for another day .
it &apos;s said that nothing is more pre@@ ci@@ ous than time .
are there any b@@ ag@@ s in this sho@@ p ?
hurry up , girls .
you &apos;ll be ready .
that was very ru@@ de .
he &apos;s pain@@ ting his house .
Tom looks like a fo@@ re@@ ig@@ ner .
I had two co@@ pi@@ es of the book .
I did it in a hurry .
please tell me which bus to take to go do@@ w@@ n@@ town .
tell me what you did on your ho@@ li@@ days .
I think you need someone to talk to .
I still love this bicy@@ cle .
I &apos;ve lear@@ ned so much from my mist@@ a@@ kes , I &apos;m thinking of ma@@ king a few more ! !
there is nothing like sleep .
your watch is ten minutes s@@ low .
I am a student at O@@ x@@ for@@ d U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity .
you must come .
I know you aren &apos;t a doctor .
it will s@@ now tomorrow .
you &apos;re too n@@ ai@@ ve .
his be@@ ard was th@@ ic@@ k and red .
I wonder if he &apos;s really sick .
we &apos;re as@@ ham@@ ed of our father &apos;s po@@ ver@@ ty .
that &apos;s interes@@ ting .
I didn &apos;t know where Tom was going , but I had a good idea where he might be going .
I &apos;ve been working on this for mon@@ ths .
what year were you born ?
please dro@@ p in when you happen to be in the nei@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od .
he is e@@ ager to please .
I didn &apos;t cat@@ ch your last name .
we &apos;re both w@@ it@@ n@@ es@@ ses .
you &apos;ll feel better after a bat@@ h .
you don &apos;t have per@@ mis@@ sion to do that .
I don &apos;t need any r@@ est .
all took part in the ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations .
his father won &apos;t come . he &apos;s very busy .
the patient was dis@@ char@@ g@@ ed from ho@@ sp@@ ital .
do you think Tom can re@@ turn ?
I have no money to buy the dic@@ tion@@ ary .
Sami re@@ f@@ used to talk .
I hope you &apos;re happy , too .
I had no place else to go .
I had been stu@@ d@@ ying music in Boston before I re@@ turned to Japan .
she vis@@ ited the old man in the ho@@ sp@@ ital every day but S@@ un@@ day .
she came to Japan for the pu@@ r@@ pose of stu@@ d@@ ying Japanese .
please take your time before deci@@ ding what to do .
I was ab@@ du@@ c@@ ted and im@@ pre@@ gn@@ ated by w@@ ol@@ ves who l@@ and@@ ed their fl@@ ying s@@ auc@@ er in my b@@ ac@@ k@@ y@@ ard .
why did G@@ od cre@@ ate the uni@@ ver@@ se ?
p@@ ass me the su@@ g@@ ar , please .
that was co@@ ol .
is this one of your cre@@ ations ?
there was a heav@@ y rain last night .
let her go .
there &apos;s been another accident .
didn &apos;t I men@@ tion that ?
I didn &apos;t tell him you were coming .
the man was young .
anyone can do it .
he is still having dou@@ b@@ ts .
they like English .
list@@ en to me , he said col@@ d@@ ly , my father was the king of K@@ ak@@ on@@ go .
this dress would look good on you .
I &apos;m telling you the truth .
she wo@@ re a red bl@@ ouse .
I st@@ ayed home for a week .
you may be right .
always .
that &apos;s so@@ ft .
the town was fu@@ ll of acti@@ v@@ ity .
leave him alone .
I had no intention of doing so .
the E@@ ar@@ th and S@@ un are just tin@@ y do@@ ts am@@ ong the b@@ il@@ li@@ ons of star@@ s in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y .
I su@@ gg@@ est we go out for a drink .
may@@ be you should just leave Tom alone .
do you re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ ze the man in this photo ?
I want to jo@@ in your tea@@ m .
don &apos;t speak so fast .
I can hear a cat s@@ cr@@ at@@ ching at the window .
there is a caf@@ et@@ er@@ ia in the univers@@ ity .
I didn &apos;t know you had so many c@@ ats .
and who was the other ?
they have an ex@@ tr@@ a bed .
you should take care of your@@ sel@@ ves .
be kind to little anim@@ als .
I don &apos;t think I could do that .
something is s@@ low@@ ing down my com@@ puter .
my com@@ puter cr@@ as@@ hed and now it won &apos;t start up .
when the des@@ ire for le@@ i@@ sure is str@@ on@@ ger than the other ur@@ g@@ es , le@@ i@@ sure w@@ ins .
we still have more than hal@@ f@@ way to go to get to the top of the m@@ oun@@ tain . are you really already ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ ed ?
few students can read L@@ ati@@ n .
how many hours a day do you spend in your office ?
I know this is hard for you to understand .
I fin@@ ally found a use for this old thing .
I want to war@@ m myself .
you must do it .
I &apos;m sorry to bo@@ ther you , but we &apos;ve got a small problem .
I admi@@ re your det@@ ermin@@ ation .
they all went to the restaurant .
I &apos;m sure I can per@@ su@@ ade Tom .
I told you it was going to be cold here .
do you want to talk about anything ?
Tom wants to stay sin@@ gle .
I &apos;m looking for@@ ward to summer vac@@ ation .
I made a po@@ t ro@@ ast .
is she still sin@@ gle ?
she is not as beautiful as her ol@@ der sister .
he &apos;s rich as C@@ ro@@ es@@ us .
don &apos;t do@@ d@@ ge the question .
why does Tom want this information ?
what would you say ?
W@@ ho@@ ever kno@@ c@@ ks get o@@ pened up to .
Tom gave me a bicy@@ cle .
Tom seems lost .
he bought a do@@ z@@ en e@@ g@@ gs .
you mi@@ sun@@ der@@ sto@@ od me .
I don &apos;t know ei@@ ther of his bro@@ th@@ ers .
you &apos;re very busy .
they will ho@@ ld tal@@ ks tomorrow .
did you write that ?
I wanted to pro@@ t@@ ect you .
we asked our teacher : &quot; where will the we@@ d@@ ding be hel@@ d ? &quot;
only a mi@@ rac@@ le may get him out of it .
can I see your dri@@ ver &apos;s lic@@ en@@ se ?
this should sol@@ ve all your probl@@ ems .
the man reading a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er is his father .
I never drink be@@ er before lun@@ ch .
did you have any lu@@ ck ?
I &apos;m a str@@ anger here .
someone th@@ re@@ w a ro@@ ck at him .
he kis@@ sed me on the fo@@ re@@ head .
Mar@@ ia didn &apos;t su@@ sp@@ ect that &quot; Tom , &quot; her p@@ en @-@ friend , with wh@@ om she had been cor@@ respon@@ ding for mon@@ ths over the Intern@@ et and wh@@ om she secre@@ tly lo@@ ved , without ever having met him , was actu@@ ally a sup@@ er @-@ intelligent s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l .
I &apos;m still at school .
how could you do it to me ?
3 cu@@ bed is 2@@ 7 .
how did you get interested in art ?
a dog sel@@ d@@ om b@@ it@@ es un@@ less it is att@@ ac@@ ked .
it &apos;s something my sister never wanted to do .
Tom main@@ t@@ ain@@ ed that he was in@@ no@@ cent .
he is a man who is fon@@ d of cer@@ em@@ on@@ y .
if only you &apos;d thought of that before sho@@ o@@ ting your big mou@@ th off .
he is very afraid of do@@ gs .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
that is ordin@@ ary @-@ looking .
you look p@@ ale as a g@@ ho@@ st .
cat@@ ch you l@@ ater .
I really don &apos;t want to talk about it .
can you help look after the k@@ ids ?
ph@@ il@@ o@@ so@@ ph@@ y is often regar@@ ded as difficult .
the radi@@ o doesn &apos;t work .
he died five years ago .
I knew we should &apos;ve tried to help Tom .
let &apos;s re@@ consi@@ der the problem .
can you help us ?
we did not exp@@ ect him to fin@@ ish the t@@ ask in so shor@@ t a time .
the sp@@ ace b@@ ar is an al@@ ph@@ an@@ u@@ meric@@ al k@@ ey@@ bo@@ ard &apos;s key .
that job is im@@ possible for me to do .
there is much su@@ g@@ ar in this black bo@@ x .
our mother had no cho@@ ice but to make dinner with le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
these two l@@ ines cut ac@@ ro@@ ss each other at right ang@@ les .
she doesn &apos;t care how she dres@@ ses .
I hate this game .
he &apos;s s@@ mar@@ t , hand@@ some and poli@@ te .
don &apos;t put all your e@@ g@@ gs in one bas@@ ket .
they got him .
I don &apos;t sleep a lot .
when I was in N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k , I happened to meet my old friend .
I want to apo@@ logi@@ ze for the way I ac@@ ted last night .
may you be tou@@ ched by H@@ is No@@ o@@ d@@ ly Ap@@ pend@@ age .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re e@@ ating what the doctor told you not to eat .
yes , but they are a lot of work .

I saw a dr@@ un@@ k l@@ ying on the road .

you can fo@@ ol all the people some of the time , and some of the people all the time , but you cannot fo@@ ol all the people all the time .
the pres@@ sure is buil@@ ding .
close the fu@@ c@@ king door !
he is interested in music .

do you really want to put your life in her hands ?
you won &apos;t stay , will you ?
she gave me h@@ ell .
I didn &apos;t k@@ ill anyone .
she was very satis@@ fi@@ ed .
how much did the ti@@ ck@@ ets cost you ?
the children s@@ li@@ d down the b@@ ank .
do you believe in a go@@ d ?
she thin@@ ks of nothing but ma@@ king money .
may I sh@@ ar@@ p@@ en my pen@@ c@@ il ?
it seems that M@@ r@@ . T@@ an@@ ak@@ a has ta@@ ken his ex@@ am .
may@@ be I went a little too far .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him to keep his prom@@ is@@ es .
I war@@ ned you ; now do as you wish .
it r@@ ains so@@ f@@ tly on the town .
that might happen on Mon@@ day .
Tom doesn &apos;t think I &apos;m interested in what he does .
the vi@@ o@@ li@@ n , the piano , and the har@@ p are mus@@ ic@@ al in@@ stru@@ ments .
I have to remember to mai@@ l this letter .
this in@@ k is the best .
he didn &apos;t re@@ pl@@ y to my letter .
I hate dri@@ ving .
how do I thank you ?
we &apos;re all working hard .
he &apos;s good at this sor@@ t of thing .
she cau@@ ght si@@ ght of a ro@@ wing bo@@ at in the dist@@ ance .
Tom likes play@@ ing tennis , but I don &apos;t .
it &apos;s s@@ et@@ t@@ led then .
F@@ ill out the ques@@ tionn@@ aire .
I &apos;m right in the mi@@ dd@@ le of doing something .
it is not too much to say that she is one of the best tennis play@@ ers in Japan .
I &apos;m still in school .
smo@@ ke f@@ illed the room .
give me all the det@@ ails .
Tom was long consi@@ der@@ ed an in@@ vin@@ ci@@ ble w@@ arri@@ or .

I know what you want to talk about .
I don &apos;t have enough R@@ A@@ M .
Tom pre@@ f@@ ers do@@ gs to c@@ ats .
Tom and Mary lived in the same town .
good night !
you should have told him .
I hope the e@@ con@@ om@@ y pic@@ ks up soon .
this is not the c@@ ase with everything .
I &apos;ve heard of you .
I didn &apos;t see him again after that .
was that what Tom said ?
he called out for help .
I work in the fi@@ el@@ d of art .
you should think of this as an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity .
&quot; may I speak to M@@ r N@@ ak@@ ag@@ aw@@ a ? &quot; &quot; spea@@ king . &quot;
there are only a few mist@@ a@@ kes , or per@@ hap@@ s n@@ one at all .
Tom and Mary jo@@ in@@ ed the grou@@ p .
he re@@ ques@@ ted that I come here again this af@@ ter@@ noon .
I &apos;ve got a bon@@ er .
I think Tom is dr@@ un@@ k .
my as@@ sist@@ ant will hand@@ le that .
Tatoeba is more popul@@ ar than ever .
I can &apos;t dri@@ ve myself home .
he is a p@@ sy@@ chi@@ c .
she pr@@ acti@@ ces the piano in the af@@ ter@@ noon or in the ev@@ ening .
R@@ e@@ peti@@ tion pl@@ ays a very important ro@@ le in language lear@@ ning .
you don &apos;t s@@ ound con@@ vin@@ ced .
I don &apos;t need an answer right now .
his man@@ n@@ ers aren &apos;t those of a g@@ ent@@ l@@ em@@ an .
why do you want to buy this book ?
you leave me no cho@@ ice .
how do you write your last name ?
she has a nice r@@ ack .
I often feel like just going over there .
they started at the same time .
let us do the work .
I like that shi@@ rt .
the may@@ or ad@@ dres@@ sed the gen@@ er@@ al public .
not only does he speak French , he can al@@ so speak English .
as far as I know , he is a person who kee@@ ps his prom@@ is@@ es .
you &apos;re in char@@ ge now .
what is your opinion ?
the bo@@ ys play@@ ed in the mu@@ d .
how much did you char@@ ge Tom to fi@@ x his car ?
do you know anyone who nee@@ ds a job ?
I really enjo@@ y@@ ed last night .
he cont@@ in@@ u@@ ed to mo@@ ck me .
we ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se our produ@@ c@@ ts on TV .
you &apos;re sk@@ in@@ ny .
I think that everyone has to make efforts to s@@ ave nat@@ ure .
we &apos;ve been waiting for hours .
what did you dis@@ co@@ ver ?
W@@ her@@ e@@ as he was wea@@ k as a b@@ ab@@ y , he is now very str@@ ong .
he gl@@ anc@@ ed at her and saw she was angry .
go and see the doctor .
I went to don@@ ate blo@@ od today .

the boy bo@@ w@@ ed to me .
Tom nee@@ ded more time to fin@@ ish his work .
can I use your pen@@ c@@ il ?
she gave him something to drink .
how did I let this happen ?
pati@@ ence is sometimes the most eff@@ ec@@ tive wea@@ po@@ n .
when I got home , I re@@ ali@@ zed that one of my su@@ it@@ cas@@ es had dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed .
it &apos;s never too late to make am@@ ends for har@@ m done .

she is for@@ ty years old .
have you ever e@@ at@@ en at that restaurant ?

Mary said to her@@ self &quot; W@@ h@@ at sh@@ all I do ? . &quot;
it &apos;s a tri@@ fl@@ ing in@@ ci@@ dent .
come down from the t@@ ree .
why don &apos;t you leave him alone ?
tell me where you &apos;ve been .
I don &apos;t know when he will come .
look up the word in your dic@@ tion@@ ary .
I &apos;m going to di@@ e .
he was curi@@ ous to see the in@@ side .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him not to eat between me@@ als .
Tom asked for a dis@@ coun@@ t .
I was sav@@ ing this pie@@ ce of c@@ ake for you .
today &apos;s weather fo@@ rec@@ ast pro@@ ved right .

don &apos;t try to talk right now .
where did you meet your bo@@ y@@ friend ?
you had never tal@@ ked to me like that before !
he set a tr@@ a@@ p to cat@@ ch the anim@@ al .
I think he &apos;s going to be sick .
he was born on J@@ u@@ ly 2@@ 8@@ th , 1@@ 8@@ 8@@ 8 .

Tom did the best he could , but he still wasn &apos;t able to p@@ ass the cour@@ se .
I cannot accep@@ t your pres@@ ent .
you don &apos;t have to hi@@ de your feel@@ ings .
my father got home late last night .
he &apos;s a bit n@@ ai@@ ve .
you can &apos;t hurt my feel@@ ings .
we miss Tom terri@@ b@@ ly .
about four th@@ ous@@ and sol@@ di@@ ers were killed .
Tom has so@@ ld his house in Boston .
it &apos;s been hun@@ dre@@ ds of years since just one person could gr@@ as@@ p the whole of scientifi@@ c kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge .
his car is g@@ ain@@ ing on us .
these books are heav@@ y .
I like com@@ ic books .
he made a little st@@ at@@ ue out of so@@ ft cl@@ ay .
I &apos;m going to stay here for s@@ ever@@ al days .
he &apos;s a to@@ t@@ al w@@ re@@ ck .
I pre@@ fer to walk .
I love H@@ it@@ om@@ i .
J@@ i@@ m was able to ho@@ ld back his anger and avo@@ id a fi@@ ght .
I &apos;m just a teacher .
she was for@@ ced to conf@@ ess .
we &apos;re going to the b@@ each . wan@@ n@@ a come ?
I &apos;m happy , too .
they were seen to go out .
who am I talking with ?
you have only to study hard , and you will p@@ ass the t@@ est .
the O@@ ne is the beg@@ in@@ ning of all things .
time was run@@ ning out for the E@@ ar@@ th@@ l@@ ings as their plan@@ et@@ ary en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment was in dec@@ ay . sp@@ ace trav@@ el became a necess@@ ity .
I &apos;m H@@ el@@ en C@@ ar@@ tw@@ right &apos;s daughter .
Tom has already so@@ ld his car .
G@@ od is the ab@@ solu@@ te being .
no in@@ v@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ation is re@@ qui@@ red .
a won@@ der@@ ful vie@@ w , isn &apos;t it ?
I love you both .
you &apos;re a pru@@ de .
I &apos;ve already dr@@ un@@ k hal@@ f a bo@@ ttle of wine while I was waiting for you .
the house has been em@@ p@@ ty for years .
I got in@@ ju@@ red in the tr@@ aff@@ ic accident .
you &apos;re k@@ ill@@ ing me .
do you really want me to help you ?
but hu@@ man be@@ ings are differ@@ ent .
can &apos;t you en@@ h@@ ance the im@@ age ?
Tom p@@ us@@ hed back his ch@@ air and got up .
there are more important things in life .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary &apos;s last name was .
I &apos;m sure I can find something for you to do .
to believe himself in the port of N@@ a@@ pl@@ es , all that was nee@@ ded was to see the g@@ list@@ ening of k@@ ni@@ ves .
all I want is money .
we cli@@ m@@ bed right up to the top .
how long have you known M@@ is@@ s S@@ m@@ ith ?
the gu@@ es@@ ts are all g@@ one .
an id@@ eal p@@ il@@ low is av@@ ai@@ l@@ able from a mai@@ l @-@ order house .
the right is on my side .
bo@@ ys are more ag@@ g@@ res@@ sive than girls .
nothing ever makes him angry .
she said that she would fol@@ low him no matter where he went .
you don &apos;t have the right .
my bo@@ ss turned down his propos@@ al .
I &apos;ve lear@@ ned a lot about mo@@ der@@ n au@@ th@@ ors .
Tom married a much youn@@ ger woman .
Tom was w@@ ear@@ ing his p@@ a@@ jam@@ as when he o@@ pened the door .
Tom cel@@ e@@ br@@ ated his for@@ ti@@ et@@ h bir@@ th@@ day the other day , without pom@@ p or cer@@ em@@ on@@ y .
you get out only what you put in .
he is concer@@ ned about his father &apos;s ill@@ ness .
I &apos;m looking for@@ ward to see@@ ing him .
is English spo@@ ken in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a ?
that class ta@@ kes place once per week .
the vo@@ te is un@@ anim@@ ous .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him not to dri@@ ve too fast , but he wouldn &apos;t list@@ en to her .
money doesn &apos;t g@@ row on tre@@ es , you know .
I thought it difficult for her to get the ti@@ cket .
M@@ i@@ y@@ az@@ ak@@ i is not what it used to be .
John &apos;s grand@@ mother pass@@ ed away after a long ill@@ ness .
sto@@ ri@@ es often have happy end@@ ings .
together , anything is possible .
Tom is a nat@@ ur@@ al ath@@ le@@ te .
they tried to dis@@ cour@@ age him from going .
there &apos;s no need to be ru@@ de .
Tom has to call his grand@@ mother .
what &apos;s the last thing you remember ?
you &apos;re not leav@@ ing until I say it &apos;s O@@ K .
keep up the good work .
he was im@@ patient to see his daughter .
I think we may have met some@@ where before .
I &apos;ll go do@@ w@@ n@@ st@@ ai@@ rs .
she was j@@ e@@ al@@ ous .
this dist@@ ri@@ c@@ t is no@@ to@@ ri@@ ous for air po@@ l@@ lution .
we play@@ ed . we lost . how about star@@ ting it over ?
Tom ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed his family .
you ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly don &apos;t have time .
a friend of mine asked me to s@@ end her a pos@@ t@@ c@@ ard .
no one believ@@ ed his story .
after three hours in the cas@@ in@@ o , he &apos;s $ 2@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 in the ho@@ le .
I hi@@ d myself behind a cu@@ r@@ tain .
father has g@@ one f@@ is@@ h@@ ing .
who believ@@ es that ?
he had a cr@@ ush on her .
what is at is@@ su@@ e in this de@@ b@@ ate is the sur@@ viv@@ al of our plan@@ et .
it was quite easy for me to car@@ ry the plan out .
you look happy .
I heard you .
why are you fl@@ in@@ ching ?
you look just like my sister .
we want to cap@@ ture all the uni@@ qu@@ en@@ ess of each language . and we as well want to cap@@ ture their ev@@ o@@ lution through time .
don &apos;t feel em@@ barrass@@ ed . these things happen .
I live too far away .
you &apos;re too s@@ low .
we &apos;re late because of you .
I made her c@@ ry .
what sh@@ all we eat tonight ?
she looks fam@@ ili@@ ar .
I was thinking about getting a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce .
I hope your parents like me .
I &apos;ve been a teacher for 1@@ 5 years .
you look f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous .
leave the book where it was .
I re@@ f@@ used to believe it .
the trans@@ l@@ ation is true to the ori@@ g@@ in@@ al .
Mary was won@@ der@@ ing wh@@ e@@ ther she coun@@ ted for Tom as a m@@ ere word or as a re@@ al person .
have you finished wri@@ ting that s@@ ong you &apos;ve been working on ?
I have three times more books than he has .
I &apos;m going to be your la@@ w@@ yer .
I wonder if you &apos;d help us .
you &apos;re suppos@@ ed to help your friends when they &apos;re in trou@@ ble .
put this senten@@ ce into English .
he doesn &apos;t study as hard as he used to .
they have s@@ car@@ cel@@ y g@@ one out since the b@@ ab@@ y was born .
why do you always want to do things the hard way ?
he wal@@ ked through the for@@ est .
gl@@ ory to U@@ k@@ rai@@ ne !

I have to go to bed .
she was st@@ un@@ ned .

your doctor s@@ ays you &apos;re going to be O@@ K .
I can &apos;t imag@@ ine living without el@@ ec@@ tri@@ city .
I h@@ it my head and saw star@@ s .
I miss his kis@@ ses .
she ho@@ l@@ ds a sen@@ i@@ or pos@@ ition in the go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment .
I didn &apos;t think we would be so busy today .
don &apos;t you worry about a thing .
you &apos;re sil@@ ly .
you have to go .
T@@ ri@@ ang@@ les don &apos;t have four ang@@ les .
it was a compl@@ e@@ te c@@ lu@@ st@@ er@@ fu@@ ck .
we need to buy a new ru@@ g for this room .
what &apos;s your f@@ avo@@ rite number ?
it &apos;s a good thing to read good books when you are young .
look .
yesterday was hot .
I know the dri@@ ll .
he re@@ p@@ ai@@ rs his own car .
please make way for him .
let &apos;s get the party ro@@ ll@@ ing .

that &apos;s all we do here .
I read .
this book is wor@@ th@@ y of pr@@ aise .
they &apos;re mine .
I don &apos;t have to list@@ en to this .
Tom is watching me work .
you didn &apos;t tell me everything .
have you ever been in love ?
she &apos;s shor@@ t of money to cont@@ in@@ ue her stu@@ di@@ es .
five years have pass@@ ed since they came to Japan .
he f@@ illed the gl@@ ass with wine .
is that all you want to know ?
let her talk .
I know no one in this city .
she won &apos;t be pl@@ eas@@ ed .
the vol@@ can@@ o er@@ up@@ ts .
she is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of th@@ under .
I didn &apos;t know you then .
I know the st@@ ati@@ sti@@ c@@ s .
we el@@ ected M@@ r J@@ or@@ d@@ an ch@@ ai@@ r@@ person .
she came to like the new teacher .
can we get this g@@ ate open ?
you &apos;re over@@ confi@@ dent .
what he said turned out to be a lie .
where is the mus@@ eu@@ m ?
I &apos;m sorry that I can &apos;t be who you want me to be .
the st@@ re@@ ets are cle@@ an .
who is call@@ ing , please ?
if you go up@@ st@@ ai@@ rs and turn right you will find your room .

we &apos;re not interested .
let &apos;s go to the ex@@ change to ex@@ change some dollars for fran@@ c@@ s .
O@@ ri@@ ent@@ e@@ er@@ ing re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es ph@@ y@@ si@@ cal f@@ it@@ ness as well as a high lev@@ el of ment@@ al per@@ form@@ ance .
I guess you know I &apos;ve mis@@ sed you .
I see money , but I don &apos;t see go@@ ld .
I read the book .
don &apos;t speak ill of him in public .
there are no re@@ al vis@@ ions .
it &apos;s almost over .
he is less intelligent than me .
what are you play@@ ing at ?
bas@@ tard !
I don &apos;t know how else to say it .
he had es@@ t@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ed a so@@ li@@ d re@@ pu@@ t@@ ation as a man of char@@ ac@@ ter .
I am not fam@@ ili@@ ar with his char@@ ac@@ ter .
what exactly is your book about ?
she go@@ es to her family &apos;s home in France every summer .
Ap@@ par@@ ent@@ ly , there is nothing that cannot happen today .
can you cr@@ ank up the he@@ at ?
can &apos;t you just leave me alone ?
I wai@@ ted up .
does your gir@@ l@@ friend like flow@@ ers ?
you aren &apos;t o@@ bli@@ g@@ ated to come if you don &apos;t want to .
we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
she dri@@ ed her t@@ ears .
it was fai@@ r .
the teacher and I s@@ at face to face .
it is too good to be true .
we &apos;re w@@ il@@ d@@ ly looking for ev@@ id@@ ence of our own ex@@ ist@@ ence .
I wish it was as sim@@ ple as that .
you &apos;re cr@@ azy or what ?

I b@@ et you &apos;re feel@@ ing really good right now .
I like that kind of stu@@ f@@ f .
I &apos;ll do anything .
the do@@ gs are in the gar@@ d@@ en .
du@@ e to the s@@ now , the train was d@@ el@@ ayed .
a book is always an accep@@ table gi@@ ft .
what am I suppos@@ ed to do with that ?
break a le@@ g .
Ch@@ rist@@ op@@ her C@@ o@@ lu@@ m@@ bus demand@@ ed that an enti@@ re &quot; C@@ o@@ lu@@ m@@ bus W@@ ee@@ k &quot; be set as@@ ide to cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate his gl@@ ory , but in the end only got a day , and only in Americ@@ a .
if only I &apos;d h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t st@@ ayed so long !
how long have you been tea@@ ching in S@@ ab@@ a@@ h ?
that doesn &apos;t inter@@ est us at all .
a grou@@ p of young m@@ en are play@@ ing hand@@ ball in the play@@ gr@@ ound .
everyone is fri@@ end@@ ly to her .
Sami wo@@ re black j@@ e@@ ans .
is that your m@@ om ?
she is lu@@ cky .
the dog looks sick .
he who thin@@ ks he has lear@@ ned enough has lear@@ ned nothing .
I really miss you .
I don &apos;t like your s@@ mi@@ le .
it &apos;s not f@@ un@@ ny .
Tom thought that Mary was as@@ le@@ ep .
we &apos;ll make up for the lo@@ ss .
the off@@ er is too good to be turned down .
why can &apos;t I play with my friends ?
I study English every day .
I don &apos;t trans@@ late for free .
the th@@ i@@ ef got away with the money .
just looking at her , you can tell that she likes you .
S@@ an@@ ta C@@ l@@ au@@ s , I want to rec@@ ei@@ ve a gir@@ l@@ friend for Ch@@ rist@@ m@@ as .
Tom sh@@ ouldn &apos;t spend so much .
I miss you .
parents need to set the ru@@ les around the house .
I didn &apos;t want you to get in@@ vol@@ ved .
he would often go f@@ is@@ h@@ ing .
the French are our nei@@ gh@@ b@@ ors ac@@ ro@@ ss the Ch@@ an@@ nel .
the la@@ w doesn &apos;t ap@@ pl@@ y to this c@@ ase .
take a look around you .
you &apos;re not al@@ low@@ ed in there .
that would be dis@@ as@@ tr@@ ous . H@@ e@@ av@@ en for@@ f@@ end !
you have a lot of ner@@ ve !
I don &apos;t want to talk about this now .
that makes everything simpl@@ er .
by the way , where were you ?
I don &apos;t know what to make of this .
I knew this moment would come .
Tom decided to go home early .
world W@@ ar I bro@@ ke out in 19@@ 1@@ 4 .
who can tell me how a light bu@@ l@@ b works ?
I &apos;d like to find out what this is .
wasn &apos;t that enough for you ?
I &apos;m going to ask you something .
Tom knows very little about s@@ por@@ ts .
the phone b@@ ill was very high this mon@@ th .
I don &apos;t have time to say this t@@ wi@@ ce , so list@@ en car@@ e@@ fu@@ l@@ ly .
curi@@ o@@ s@@ ity killed the cat .
are you s@@ aying I sm@@ ell bad ?
do you want to play with me ?
I love this place .
he likes not only music but s@@ por@@ ts .
it was not my intention .
H@@ o@@ w@@ ever , the prin@@ c@@ ess had b@@ arri@@ c@@ ad@@ ed her@@ self in her room and wouldn &apos;t come out .

Tom does what he wants to .
no one fol@@ low@@ ed us .
what cri@@ ter@@ ion did you use when you el@@ ected this ess@@ ay as the win@@ ner ?

can you tell me about that con@@ vers@@ ation ?
her name was un@@ known .
why have you for@@ go@@ tten the po@@ t@@ ato@@ es and not the be@@ er ?
did you tell Tom he could b@@ orrow your car ?
there are some people who hate the idea of the Euro@@ pe@@ an C@@ om@@ m@@ un@@ ity .
sometimes I smo@@ ke just to give my hands something to do .
you look a little sh@@ a@@ ken .
B@@ on voyage !
there are people here who need your help .

Tom wanted Mary to meet his friends .
he probab@@ ly has a gir@@ l@@ friend already .
there are a lot of bri@@ d@@ g@@ es in this city .
is there any@@ where you want to go ?
I got busy .
Tom is a go@@ l@@ d@@ sm@@ ith .

R@@ i@@ ch@@ ard O@@ f Y@@ or@@ k G@@ ave B@@ att@@ le I@@ n V@@ ain .
it is all I want to do .
you must read between the l@@ ines .
I apo@@ logi@@ zed for having been late for school .
I can &apos;t help you today .
the so@@ c@@ cer ball is r@@ ound .
the dog was d@@ ead .
the ey@@ e is sen@@ si@@ tive to light .
you should have been more careful .
you will get the wor@@ st be@@ ating of your life .
I &apos;m lon@@ ely without you .
we are ho@@ ping to visit S@@ pain this summer .
Tom has@@ n &apos;t said a word .
he used to read a lot .
is that under@@ sto@@ od ?
is it all right to eat out tonight ?
my parents sent me to f@@ at cam@@ p when I was thir@@ te@@ en .
she seems to be interested in him .
how did you find me ?
the girl p@@ aus@@ ed and sm@@ il@@ ed ; the young man p@@ aus@@ ed and si@@ gh@@ ed .
I didn &apos;t tell anyone .
they all came by bi@@ ke .
you should not sleep .
living without ill@@ us@@ ions is the secret to happ@@ in@@ ess .
it was just as I thought .
take this to your mother .
don &apos;t forget to s@@ end that letter .
why are you so interested ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to buy a dec@@ ent car .
you don &apos;t have to get up so early .
to tell the truth , I compl@@ et@@ ely for@@ got .
have you g@@ one cr@@ azy ?
she has never fall@@ en in love .
I was at the party .
this ty@@ pe of person is bor@@ ing .
B@@ y@@ e , S@@ ay@@ ok@@ o !
he lost a fort@@ une in the sto@@ ck mar@@ ket .
sec@@ tion 9 of the En@@ danger@@ ed S@@ p@@ ec@@ ies A@@ c@@ t makes it il@@ le@@ g@@ al to take an end@@ anger@@ ed spec@@ ies of fish or w@@ il@@ d@@ life .
yes , that was am@@ az@@ ing . U@@ n@@ believ@@ able !
what do you want to see while you &apos;re here ?
I wonder if anything happened to him .
I love all of you .
what &apos;s going on down there ?
it is pre@@ mat@@ ure to dis@@ c@@ us@@ s it now .
no one knows her .
we often hear you sing .
he diff@@ ers from his brother .
when are you going home ?
they w@@ av@@ ed fl@@ ag@@ s to w@@ el@@ come the prin@@ c@@ ess .
he was be@@ coming a fam@@ ous sin@@ ger .
I qu@@ it smoking .
I know that you and Tom are friends .
we were att@@ ac@@ ked by sw@@ ar@@ ms of be@@ es .
f@@ ear is a bad ad@@ vis@@ er .
it &apos;s a very small pri@@ ce for such an important vi@@ c@@ t@@ ory .
Sami didn &apos;t want to be sh@@ am@@ ed in the village by his che@@ ating wife .
Tom isn &apos;t a min@@ or .
Tom took out a b@@ a@@ g of mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
you know this isn &apos;t the way we should be doing this .
I gave the house to you .
what do you re@@ gre@@ t most ?
don &apos;t say I didn &apos;t war@@ n you .
the little girl , de@@ e@@ pl@@ y mo@@ ved by the old man &apos;s pi@@ ti@@ ful story , bur@@ st into t@@ ears .
it de@@ p@@ ends on how much money you have .
he wants to be a doctor in the future .
he likes ta@@ king wal@@ ks .
what are your con@@ cl@@ us@@ ions ?
put the p@@ li@@ ers in the to@@ ol bo@@ x .
the route was blo@@ c@@ ked by a t@@ ree .
I often play@@ ed tru@@ ant .
Tom has coll@@ ected a great many bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ li@@ es .
now sh@@ ake hands and make up .
the S@@ un sm@@ il@@ ed through the window every morning .
I was in way over my head .
I have no parti@@ cul@@ ar tal@@ ent .
Tom knew this was going to happen .
guess what I found on the b@@ each .
I &apos;ve sp@@ ent a lot .
the girl who lives next door is very pretty .
we should have told him the truth .
they are out sho@@ p@@ ping .
Tom is det@@ ermin@@ ed to lo@@ se we@@ ight .
they are ac@@ t@@ ors .
I &apos;m looking for someone who can speak P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese .
some people say that the the@@ ory of ev@@ o@@ lution is &quot; only &quot; a the@@ ory but a scientifi@@ c the@@ ory is something that has been pro@@ v@@ en to be true .
there &apos;s no so@@ a@@ p .
I felt de@@ press@@ ed .
they sp@@ ent the af@@ ter@@ noon around the po@@ ol .
I couldn &apos;t find it any@@ where .
can you show me ?
we &apos;ll take part in the mar@@ ath@@ on .
what &apos;s your di@@ agno@@ s@@ is ?
some@@ day the U@@ S@@ A will el@@ ect a woman pres@@ i@@ dent , and it won &apos;t be pretty .
if you tell Tom what to do , he &apos;ll do it .
this anim@@ al is mine .
it &apos;s A@@ pri@@ l first .
he will soon get used to the cli@@ m@@ ate here .
what kind of person am I ?
I admi@@ re your ignor@@ ance .
if I s@@ cre@@ w up , what &apos;s the wor@@ st that can happen ?
what you did to Tom was cr@@ u@@ el .
that ro@@ ck b@@ and gi@@ ves me a h@@ ea@@ d@@ ache .
I can &apos;t forget about that stupi@@ d mo@@ vie .
who gi@@ ves a fu@@ ck ?
no one could den@@ y this .
both he and I are high school students .
c@@ lear@@ ly , this is the most important point .
they &apos;re against anim@@ al ab@@ use .

how about for tomorrow ?
she can speak R@@ us@@ si@@ an .

we like nobody and nobody likes us .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here .
be pre@@ par@@ ed .
I think that they will fol@@ low us .
I app@@ reci@@ ate your sup@@ port .
Tom in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced himself .
I am just war@@ ming up now .
he re@@ turned home for the first time in ten years .
does it bo@@ ther you if I smo@@ ke ?
she has a piano les@@ son once a week .
it go@@ es without s@@ aying that smoking is bad for the heal@@ th .
the train was d@@ el@@ ayed because of heav@@ y s@@ no@@ w@@ f@@ all .
I hate them all .
it is very f@@ ine today .
I o@@ we you my life .
Mary is a better swim@@ mer than J@@ ane .
are you really going to let Tom do that ?
he doesn &apos;t look happy to see us .
fran@@ k@@ ly , I don &apos;t like your idea .
Tom must learn French .
Mary is thir@@ st@@ y .
no @-@ one invit@@ ed her .
I know something you don &apos;t .
are we m@@ ad s@@ qu@@ ir@@ rel@@ s ?
the st@@ ab@@ ili@@ ty of Ch@@ in@@ ese e@@ con@@ om@@ y is sub@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ ally over@@ es@@ ti@@ mat@@ ed .
I felt bad about what I did .
do you get it ?
may I ask you some more questions ?
this mo@@ v@@ ement from r@@ ur@@ al to ur@@ b@@ an ar@@ e@@ as has been going on for over two hun@@ d@@ red years .
s@@ end it to me .
you can &apos;t smo@@ ke here .
do you have a blo@@ g ?
I met her late in the ev@@ ening .
when is the brea@@ k@@ fast ser@@ ved ?
I &apos;m here with a friend .
do you want me to believe that ?
Tom was afraid of fai@@ lu@@ re .
I mess@@ ed up .
O@@ w !
she would have been very pr@@ ou@@ d of you .
I &apos;ve been wal@@ king on cr@@ u@@ t@@ ches ever since I bro@@ ke my fo@@ ot .
this idea has never en@@ ter@@ ed my head before .
I don &apos;t understand any of this .
I &apos;m very surprised to see you here .
Tom doesn &apos;t have the money to buy a car .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
the R@@ h@@ ine run@@ s between France and Ger@@ many .
they went to the public swimming po@@ ol .
I said that this was a meeting room , not a be@@ d@@ room !
the E@@ ar@@ th is a big ball .
it &apos;s my turn to tell you a secret .
what are you doing , D@@ ad ?
you &apos;re living in the past .
where exactly did you go ?
why can &apos;t I see you ?
I kind of li@@ ked them .
I &apos;m glad to have this op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to speak to you .
nothing se@@ em@@ ed out of the ordin@@ ary .
did you actu@@ ally see it ?
I must buy a new win@@ ter co@@ at .
I know you &apos;re just trying to help , and I app@@ reci@@ ate that .
the re@@ vo@@ lution won &apos;t be so@@ ber .
must I take this me@@ dic@@ ine ?
before cro@@ s@@ sing any st@@ re@@ et , look first left , then right , and left again .
that &apos;s str@@ ange . I could have s@@ wor@@ n that I &apos;d lo@@ c@@ ked this door .
I &apos;ve been looking for you every@@ where .
by all me@@ ans .
we miss you very much .
Sami was we@@ al@@ th@@ y in l@@ and .
a tea@@ m of par@@ am@@ e@@ dic@@ s is stand@@ ing by .
they hon@@ o@@ red me on my bir@@ th@@ day .
just think about how you &apos;d feel in a sim@@ il@@ ar situation .
do you want money ?
Tom stu@@ t@@ ters .
Tom c@@ aus@@ ed quite a lot of trou@@ ble .
it &apos;s com@@ puter @-@ gen@@ er@@ ated .
he e@@ ats nothing more than fru@@ it .
how many people can fit in your car ?
s@@ qu@@ ir@@ rel@@ s eat ac@@ or@@ n@@ s .
it &apos;s h@@ ec@@ tic at my place . how about we go back to your place and watch the game there ?
I over@@ sle@@ pt because I st@@ ayed up late .
I like ban@@ an@@ as more than ap@@ pl@@ es .
he did a pretty good job .
then the do@@ ll &apos;s eyes beg@@ an to sh@@ ine like two star@@ s and it became ali@@ ve .
the det@@ ec@@ tive took down his t@@ es@@ ti@@ mon@@ y on the spo@@ t .
I think you &apos;re dr@@ un@@ k .
we are one , after all , you and I , together we suff@@ er , together ex@@ ist and fo@@ re@@ ver will rec@@ re@@ ate each other .
it &apos;s an ou@@ tr@@ age .
we all became sol@@ di@@ ers .
I hate these sho@@ es .
Tom is too young to go to school .
I don &apos;t like pay@@ ing tax@@ es .
Tom g@@ ets up at six every morning .
you &apos;re no fun anymore .
she got him into trou@@ ble .
&quot; stop beg@@ g@@ ing for a co@@ ok@@ ie , T@@ i@@ m , &quot; his mu@@ m said , &quot; R@@ em@@ ember , &apos; Ch@@ il@@ dren who ask get sk@@ i@@ p@@ ped . &apos; &quot;
Tom and Mary are a mus@@ ic@@ al du@@ o .
I don &apos;t understand why people believe in g@@ ho@@ sts .
senten@@ ces can tea@@ ch us a lot . and a lot more than just words .
I succ@@ ee@@ ded in getting what I wanted .
that &apos;s what I hope .
it mat@@ ters .
what kind of t@@ at@@ too do you want ?
he den@@ i@@ ed the ru@@ mo@@ r .
I have six mou@@ ths to fe@@ ed .
don &apos;t eat like a pi@@ g .
you &apos;re the most beautiful woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
get that thing off of me .
there &apos;s no place like home .
Tom is eas@@ y@@ going , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s just a mi@@ sun@@ der@@ stand@@ ing .
I suppose you want to ask me where I &apos;ve been .
it was him that bro@@ ke the window yesterday .
run as fast as you can and don &apos;t let go of my hand .
when were you thinking of coming back to the S@@ t@@ ates ?
the poor old man was re@@ du@@ ced to just a sk@@ el@@ et@@ on .
where &apos;s my phone ?
Tom couldn &apos;t do something like that .
the b@@ ab@@ y ta@@ kes after his mother .
I was tem@@ p@@ ted to call in sick .
the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ life is better in N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k .
you have be@@ tr@@ ayed us .
Tom made Mary happy .
I would al@@ so take a lot of money .
it &apos;s the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate t@@ est .
J@@ u@@ g@@ gl@@ ing is actu@@ ally a lot eas@@ ier than it looks .
Mary knows nothing of se@@ wing or k@@ n@@ it@@ ting .
my last name is J@@ ones .
that &apos;s sor@@ t of nice .
he dri@@ ves a tru@@ ck .
everyone was s@@ cre@@ am@@ ing .
give me a ham@@ mer .
bir@@ ds f@@ ly long dist@@ ances .
busy as usu@@ al ?
they kno@@ c@@ ked on the door and said they had come to ar@@ r@@ est him .
I wai@@ ted for an h@@ our , but he didn &apos;t app@@ ear .
I got up while it was still dar@@ k .
what does this pain@@ ting re@@ pres@@ ent ?
the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ log@@ ist asked me a whole bat@@ ter@@ y of questions .
she left the ho@@ sp@@ ital an h@@ our ago .
I wai@@ ted for him all day long .
this was his one and only hope .
I st@@ op@@ ped at the store and got some milk on my way back .
be nice .
he is just mus@@ ic@@ ally gi@@ f@@ ted . he m@@ as@@ ter@@ ed the gu@@ it@@ ar in one year at the age of 1@@ 5 .
the se@@ a is very gre@@ en .
do you think something like that will re@@ pe@@ at it@@ self ?
guess wh@@ ose bir@@ th@@ day it is today .
do you love me ?
some of these are mine .
there is a school down the m@@ oun@@ tain .
promise me you won &apos;t do that again .
who left this m@@ ess in the to@@ il@@ et ?
any c@@ lu@@ es ?
he became world @-@ fam@@ ous for his dis@@ co@@ very .
you need to s@@ ave the prin@@ c@@ ess .
who won today ?
ex@@ cu@@ se me . can you direc@@ t me to the ne@@ ar@@ est sub@@ way station ?
I list@@ en@@ ed to the radi@@ o while I wor@@ ked .
this is your chance .
leave me alone .
I met Bo@@ b and Mary while I was waiting for K@@ ate .
Tom es@@ cap@@ ed .
can you do a hand@@ stand ?
who does your dec@@ or@@ ating ?
that s@@ oun@@ ds like a great idea .
I was about to go out when the phone r@@ ang .
after what has happened , I d@@ are not see her again .
you &apos;re very busy .
you are to see a doctor at once .
ad@@ d the may@@ onn@@ aise .
Ger@@ many was once al@@ li@@ ed with I@@ tal@@ y .
do your parents know about this ?
I &apos;m sure that I &apos;ll miss her a lot .
I was too tired to care for anything but bed .
he won a go@@ ld me@@ d@@ al .
that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong with you .
both Tom and Mary smo@@ ke .
it &apos;s ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant .
the man is e@@ ating bre@@ ad .
he is of a hu@@ mor@@ ous turn of mind .
A@@ aw@@ w ! he &apos;s so cu@@ te .
K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ st@@ an is one of the dev@@ el@@ op@@ ed coun@@ tri@@ es in C@@ entr@@ al A@@ si@@ a .
I can &apos;t thank you enough for all your k@@ in@@ d@@ ness .
he k@@ ept his sense of hu@@ mo@@ r until the day he died .
I need more pap@@ er for my dr@@ a@@ win@@ gs .
Tom has two le@@ gs .
I will be working on my re@@ port all day tomorrow .
I &apos;m trying to remember .
for the time being , I inten@@ d to stay at a ho@@ tel .
you should go and have your hair cut .
as usu@@ al , he was the last to arrive at the the@@ ater .
I know Tom is a good ac@@ tor .
could you please take care of my dog while I &apos;m in Boston ?
do you know how to play ma@@ h@@ j@@ ong ?
I am not a doctor , but a teacher .
I think it &apos;s very li@@ k@@ ely that they &apos;ll arrive next week .
as he couldn &apos;t end@@ ure , he took to his he@@ els .
the ju@@ ry didn &apos;t buy Dan &apos;s story .
is anyone else going ?
you don &apos;t even know how .
nobody can hear you there .
the door was already open .
I love the way Tom does that .
do you have any bro@@ th@@ ers or sist@@ ers ?
&quot; Mary , the coffee is too str@@ ong for me . &quot; &quot; Oh , I am sorry . per@@ hap@@ s ad@@ d a little milk . &quot;
he made a s@@ pe@@ ec@@ h in which he sup@@ por@@ ted my opinion .
I didn &apos;t know what I &apos;d find .
Tom has@@ n &apos;t re@@ ali@@ zed his mist@@ ake yet .
if you go to that su@@ per@@ mar@@ ket , you can buy most things you use in your d@@ ai@@ ly life .
let &apos;s r@@ est a little .
there was ab@@ solu@@ tel@@ y nothing you could do about it .
do you like hor@@ ro@@ r mo@@ vi@@ es ?
wh@@ ose turn is it ?
do you have any advice for me ?
J@@ ane is not as t@@ all as Mary .
where does John live ?
I loo@@ ked around and no@@ ti@@ ced that mine was the only car on the road .
I think that &apos;s the best answer .
what fo@@ ods , if any , do you avo@@ id e@@ ating ?
I &apos;m not as busy as Tom .
I don &apos;t know how to do it .
that arti@@ cle makes fun of ve@@ get@@ ari@@ ans .
did you take the money ?
Sami re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ zed the man in the photo .
we should just enjo@@ y this and not worry about how much it co@@ sts .
he &apos;s a hun@@ k .
I asked you first .
she &apos;s right behind you .
the res@@ ul@@ t was ra@@ ther dis@@ appoin@@ ting .
Tom didn &apos;t come to the last meeting .
by 20@@ 30 tw@@ ent@@ y @-@ one per@@ cent of its popul@@ ation will be over si@@ x@@ ty @-@ five .
where did you hear that story ?
I lear@@ ned how to use a ham@@ mer from my d@@ ad .
we lost on that job .
he has a pi@@ th@@ y re@@ mar@@ k for every oc@@ cas@@ ion .
she wo@@ re heart @-@ sh@@ ap@@ ed ear@@ r@@ ings .
when I run , I get sw@@ e@@ at@@ y .
left @-@ wing comm@@ un@@ is@@ m is an in@@ f@@ an@@ ti@@ le dis@@ order .

I was@@ h my app@@ le .
he is an ac@@ ro@@ b@@ at .
your brother is sick .
Tom sh@@ ouldn &apos;t make fun of Mary .
he did what he prom@@ is@@ ed to do for me .
she tre@@ ated him like a king .
Tom is not cr@@ ying .
tell us how to sol@@ ve the problem .
you didn &apos;t make it clear .
she &apos;s well st@@ ac@@ ked .
be mer@@ ci@@ ful .
I spo@@ ke to him yesterday .
she &apos;s no s@@ ain@@ t .
I dre@@ am@@ ed I had been ab@@ du@@ c@@ ted by ali@@ ens .
I &apos;m in way over my head .
Tom will re@@ fu@@ se to do that .
she p@@ us@@ hed him off the pi@@ er .
I don &apos;t exp@@ ect you to understand it .
give a th@@ i@@ ef enough ro@@ pe and he &apos;ll h@@ ang himself .
I still can &apos;t understand that .
Tom left his tru@@ m@@ p@@ et at school .
he arrived at mi@@ d@@ night .
this looks good .
we went on a pic@@ ni@@ c together .
you &apos;re cre@@ ep@@ y .
Tom often makes the same mist@@ a@@ kes .
I hear that Mary is very pretty .
I don &apos;t get it .
I went there times without number .
the company man@@ u@@ fac@@ tures a v@@ ari@@ et@@ y of pap@@ er go@@ ods .
you didn &apos;t have to fin@@ ish early .
I know that &apos;s not what you want .
this is Tom &apos;s shi@@ rt , not mine .
I would like to be able to jo@@ in the W@@ h@@ at@@ s@@ Ap@@ p G@@ rou@@ p .
my doctor ad@@ vis@@ ed me to give up smoking .
I know you &apos;re still in love with me .
I can &apos;t figu@@ re out anything .
he do@@ tes on his grand@@ son .
I &apos;ve been trying to get your attention .
who was respon@@ sible ?
I am at the b@@ ank .
you see@@ m happy .
he was a go@@ d to his people .
is this your daughter ?
I need more information on this matter .
Tom said he wanted those .

Tom o@@ w@@ es Mary a lot of money .
how did you sleep last night ?

Tom cl@@ aim@@ s to have p@@ sy@@ chi@@ c po@@ w@@ ers .
he must be a good boy .
if you &apos;re not careful , you might have an accident .
can you des@@ cri@@ be the situation you were in ?
are those people ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sts ?
I f@@ ed the le@@ f@@ to@@ vers to my dog .
what a to@@ t@@ al idi@@ ot !
he lived to be s@@ ev@@ ent@@ y years old .
you are free tomorrow .
I was off du@@ ty at the time .
the man never told the police what his des@@ tin@@ ation was .
these are my daugh@@ ters .
she sle@@ pt off her h@@ ang@@ over .
I &apos;m not used to getting up early .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m not getting fi@@ red .
I can look into this for you .
tr@@ aff@@ ic li@@ gh@@ ts work all the time .
don &apos;t read this senten@@ ce .
please don &apos;t go home .

I know Tom is a me@@ chan@@ ic .
my Ch@@ in@@ ese is terri@@ ble .
I need someone who I can talk to .
the boy &apos;s ag@@ g@@ res@@ sion is ma@@ king probl@@ ems .
I don &apos;t go in for that sor@@ t of thing .
the bo@@ ss doesn &apos;t know it yet .
they wal@@ ked together .
I bought her a new car .
they un@@ wr@@ app@@ ed their s@@ and@@ wi@@ ches .
ev@@ en@@ tu@@ ally it was possible to find a really satis@@ fac@@ t@@ ory so@@ lution .
he didn &apos;t look happy .
I &apos;ll ri@@ de sho@@ t@@ g@@ un .
I have a bo@@ y@@ friend who lo@@ ves me .
heal@@ th is ab@@ o@@ ve we@@ al@@ th ; the l@@ at@@ ter gi@@ ves less fort@@ une than the for@@ mer .
your re@@ qu@@ est has been den@@ i@@ ed because you have no v@@ ali@@ d res@@ id@@ enti@@ al ad@@ dress .
I did not lo@@ se my mind , I so@@ ld it on e@@ B@@ ay .
he is always a st@@ ep or two a@@ head of the times .
I can &apos;t see it .
here &apos;s the ad@@ dress .
I don &apos;t feel much like talking .

Sami is t@@ aller than me .
I@@ s@@ ra@@ el is a beautiful country .

V@@ o@@ w@@ el har@@ mon@@ y is important in the H@@ un@@ gar@@ i@@ an language .

Tom said he had more important things to do .
B@@ re@@ and@@ รก@@ n is a la@@ w@@ yer .
what &apos;s Tom good at ?
everything was difficult .
no one read@@ s my blo@@ g .
by the time he fin@@ ds out , it will be too late .
how did you lo@@ se it ?
she called him every other day .
he was late because of the s@@ now .
she said she had been happy .
how long will this go on ?
I think we &apos;re even .
I gave it my best shot .
my doctor thin@@ ks it &apos;s can@@ cer@@ ous but told me to feel free to get a secon@@ d opinion .
the cu@@ st@@ om@@ s office is at the bor@@ der .
we took tur@@ n@@ s with the dri@@ ving .

who would better his st@@ ate should look to his f@@ oun@@ d@@ ations .
the contr@@ act was end@@ ed .

I don &apos;t drink .

he got into bed .
how long was she under@@ water ?
my concer@@ n is the future .

I have to go up@@ st@@ ai@@ rs .
Dan shot M@@ at@@ t in self @-@ de@@ f@@ ence .

Tom was in love with Mar@@ ia , but she didn &apos;t want to know anything about him .
the man died a few hours ago .
I admi@@ re Tom &apos;s pers@@ ever@@ ance .
she has a thing for ol@@ der m@@ en .
everything &apos;s going to work out .
the T@@ ick@@ D@@ is@@ play f@@ un@@ c@@ tion has to be called every fr@@ ame in order to play the anim@@ ation .
the se@@ ar@@ ch for ali@@ en life is one of hu@@ man@@ kind &apos;s gre@@ at@@ est te@@ ch@@ no@@ log@@ ic@@ al ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es .
the past is no longer and the future is not yet .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ve off@@ end@@ ed you .
Mary thin@@ ks that O@@ liv@@ er is sp@@ end@@ ing too much time play@@ ing vi@@ de@@ o@@ g@@ am@@ es .

I exp@@ ect you to be pun@@ ctu@@ al .

the b@@ ab@@ y fell as@@ le@@ ep in the cr@@ ad@@ le .
we loo@@ ked around the pro@@ per@@ ty .
I can ho@@ ld my bre@@ ath for a long time .

we haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
this is something I must face alone .
what do I me@@ an to you ?
I su@@ gg@@ est you co@@ o@@ per@@ ate .
we were me@@ di@@ oc@@ re .
m@@ ea@@ sure t@@ wi@@ ce , cut once .
I didn &apos;t take the time to do it pro@@ per@@ ly .
that &apos;s a really great idea .
time is more pre@@ ci@@ ous than anything else .
where are they swimming ?
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m talking to you about this .
M@@ et@@ e@@ or@@ o@@ logi@@ sts are people who know a t@@ rem@@ end@@ ous am@@ oun@@ t about ge@@ op@@ h@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ s , th@@ er@@ mo@@ d@@ y@@ n@@ am@@ ic@@ s and cli@@ mat@@ o@@ log@@ y , and almost nothing about tomorrow &apos;s weather .
we have to find a way to get that done .
I fol@@ ded the to@@ w@@ els .
I have low blo@@ od pres@@ sure .
he sometimes comes to see me .
I told you not to come here .
what are you going to have ?
I was ev@@ en@@ tu@@ ally rel@@ eas@@ ed .
I have to go to bed .

I found my bicy@@ cle g@@ one .
I feel saf@@ e here .
we conc@@ entr@@ ated .
make yourself com@@ for@@ table .
this is a happy oc@@ cas@@ ion .
take it as it comes .
do you feel lu@@ cky ?
are there any cu@@ te girls in your class ?
it is now that it be@@ comes interes@@ ting .
Tom has decided to have the sur@@ g@@ er@@ y that his doctor re@@ comm@@ end@@ ed .
it &apos;s not a bad thing .
E@@ ri@@ c is on our so@@ c@@ cer tea@@ m .
when ice m@@ el@@ ts , it be@@ comes li@@ qui@@ d .
Tom was mau@@ led by a dog when he was a k@@ id .
we sw@@ am in the se@@ a .
he sle@@ pt until ten o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck .
the E@@ ar@@ th is just a little is@@ l@@ and and we are little is@@ l@@ and@@ ers .
she is a good li@@ ar .
I am not busy .
why don &apos;t we all go ?
let me put this in per@@ spec@@ tive for you .
nobody des@@ er@@ ves that .
I want to speak to my la@@ w@@ yer now .
can you tell us how that &apos;ll work ?
I love my y@@ el@@ low sw@@ e@@ ater .
you sh@@ all have a bicy@@ cle for your bir@@ th@@ day .
she made it pl@@ ain that she wanted to go to col@@ le@@ ge .
I was a sh@@ y child .
I suppose it makes sense to go a@@ head and pay the b@@ ill right now .
he is as@@ ham@@ ed to ask questions .
I can &apos;t turn it on , because the sw@@ it@@ ch is bro@@ ken .
these clo@@ th@@ es are di@@ r@@ ty and need to be was@@ hed .
I &apos;m sure she &apos;ll leave early .
they &apos;re reading a book .
Al@@ f@@ red , K@@ ing of En@@ gl@@ and , was a great scho@@ l@@ ar as well as a great ru@@ ler .
you need to sleep .
&quot; Oh ! they &apos;ll find him gu@@ il@@ ty , &quot; said the other . &quot; don &apos;t you be afraid of that . &quot;
I am lost .
he is getting better .
don &apos;t leave me alone .
every@@ day life can get a bit mon@@ o@@ ton@@ ous at times .
was V@@ en@@ us , a des@@ er@@ t plan@@ et with th@@ ic@@ k cl@@ ou@@ ds of sul@@ fu@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id , fo@@ re@@ telling the future of E@@ ar@@ th ?
where did you have your su@@ it made ?
I am not cert@@ ain about that .
while he was sick , he lost a lot of we@@ ight .
I &apos;ll br@@ ing wine .
do fer@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ ers cont@@ ain pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ us ?
have you already e@@ at@@ en sup@@ per ?
the su@@ n is about to ri@@ se .
it is il@@ le@@ g@@ al to par@@ k a car there .
do you know how to read a ma@@ p ?
I thought I had until 2 : 30 .
I like mat@@ h le@@ ast of all .
that has nothing to do with him .
we call him M@@ i@@ ke .
how did you get into our room ?
everybody had a hard time .
I &apos;d like some su@@ g@@ ar , please .
I am trying to ju@@ gg@@ le .
Sami used to w@@ ear gl@@ asses all the time .
I just wanted to ask you a few questions .
you must pay attention to his advice .
I don &apos;t think your see@@ ing him is good for you .
he is a true co@@ lo@@ s@@ su@@ s .
I may know someone who can help you .
here we are .
the soci@@ et@@ y in which they live is very differ@@ ent from our own .
she w@@ ro@@ te a lot of po@@ ems .
I want to talk to you .
he was born in R@@ o@@ me .
how did you become in@@ vol@@ ved in this pro@@ j@@ ect ?
ei@@ ther you or I must go in his place .
with all his fau@@ l@@ ts , he is resp@@ ected by everybody .
what a tr@@ ag@@ e@@ dy !
Tom har@@ d@@ ly ever w@@ ears a ti@@ e .
I pain@@ ted a pic@@ ture for you .
he likes to talk about himself .
there was a kno@@ ck on the door .
how did you know that man was a co@@ p ?
how did you get into my house ?
I &apos;m not a great photo@@ gr@@ ap@@ her .
it &apos;s like one of those .
she s@@ cr@@ u@@ b@@ bed the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en f@@ lo@@ or with a br@@ ush .
those do@@ ors should be clo@@ sed .
what would you do in my place ?
I go to any party I am invit@@ ed to .
there are four se@@ as@@ ons in a year - s@@ pr@@ ing , summer , f@@ all , and win@@ ter .
I want to help you get out of this m@@ ess .
Sami was already on the ro@@ ll@@ er@@ co@@ as@@ ter .
get mo@@ ving !
I must be leav@@ ing now .
she was app@@ reci@@ ab@@ ly t@@ an@@ ned after her vac@@ ation .
the wo@@ od was very dar@@ k , and she could not help t@@ rem@@ bl@@ ing from f@@ ear .
the g@@ ey@@ ser s@@ ends up a co@@ lu@@ m@@ n of hot water every two hours .
the e@@ g@@ gs are still hot .
an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake of mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de 5 sho@@ ok T@@ okyo .
this ri@@ ver run@@ s through my village .
I like h@@ ang@@ ing out here .
I want Tom to take a look at that .
do you think he will like that ?
jus@@ ti@@ ce in this country is a bit of a dou@@ ble stand@@ ard : there is the jus@@ ti@@ ce of the poor and the jus@@ ti@@ ce of the rich .
I don &apos;t eat out very often .
&quot; let &apos;s play H@@ o@@ p S@@ k@@ i@@ p An@@ d J@@ um@@ p like me , &quot; said the little wh@@ ite r@@ ab@@ bit .
I wonder what all of them have in com@@ mon .
what was the cause of the ex@@ plo@@ sion ?
I &apos;ll get my k@@ ey@@ s .
let me go !
may I in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce myself ?
left @-@ hand th@@ read@@ s have now become un@@ su@@ al in me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s but they can still be found on some objec@@ ts , such as on bicy@@ c@@ les &apos; pe@@ d@@ als , for inst@@ ance .
the B@@ B@@ C is my f@@ av@@ ou@@ rite chan@@ nel .
I p@@ aid two hun@@ d@@ red dollars in tax@@ es .
con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations , and th@@ an@@ ks for everything !
he t@@ ends to be arro@@ g@@ ant .
we remember .
it is free of char@@ ge .
will he succ@@ e@@ ed or fai@@ l ?
I just don &apos;t like it .
J@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ing from his ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance , he must be a rich man .
I want to apo@@ logi@@ ze to all of you for what just happened .
I never thought I &apos;d see her there .
I think we still have pl@@ ent@@ y of time .
what should we buy with this money ?
I &apos;m ma@@ king an appoin@@ t@@ ment for my daughter .
he succ@@ ee@@ ded to his un@@ cle &apos;s fort@@ une .
Dan didn &apos;t know where his car key was .
I miss you all the time .
you are a trou@@ bl@@ em@@ ak@@ er .
will you go to the dance with me ?
it &apos;s ex@@ pen@@ sive to mo@@ derni@@ ze a city .
what is the name of that bir@@ d ?
you &apos;re invit@@ ed .
I &apos;m talking with R@@ oc@@ รญ@@ o .
let me see .
wom@@ en often pain@@ t their fin@@ g@@ er@@ n@@ ails .
they &apos;re not a th@@ re@@ at .
Tom won &apos;t believe it .
that gu@@ y &apos;s a friend of mine .
Austr@@ ali@@ a is about tw@@ ent@@ y times lar@@ ger than Japan .
she cut the c@@ ake in two .
you hand@@ led that well .
I didn &apos;t know why Tom didn &apos;t want us there .
let &apos;s drink to his succ@@ ess .
I thought you were my friend .
do you know her at all ?
I can &apos;t hear you very well .
Sami isn &apos;t jo@@ king .
I suppose you know all about it .
I &apos;m going to s@@ it on the b@@ en@@ ch over there next to the st@@ re@@ et l@@ am@@ p .
An@@ tar@@ es is a red st@@ ar .
my little to@@ e hur@@ ts .
I have a friend in S@@ pain who spea@@ ks five langu@@ ages .
is today your bir@@ th@@ day ?
let &apos;s go to P@@ au@@ l &apos;s D@@ iner .
you ought to be qui@@ et in a li@@ br@@ ary .
Tom fell as@@ le@@ ep waiting for Mary .
V@@ en@@ us is only s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly sm@@ aller than the E@@ ar@@ th and Mar@@ s is bi@@ g@@ ger than hal@@ f of E@@ ar@@ th .
do you find that was@@ h@@ ing ma@@ ch@@ ine easy to use ?
she comm@@ it@@ ted a cri@@ me .
I am not in@@ sol@@ ent to@@ war@@ ds them .
it is easy to dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish good from ev@@ il .
how is your d@@ ad ?
br@@ ing them to me .
we did not help him , so he made it by himself .
right now , I want to speak L@@ o@@ j@@ b@@ an .
Tom drin@@ ks at le@@ ast three li@@ ters of water every day .
I &apos;ve been looking fo@@ ward to meeting you .
the th@@ r@@ ush sin@@ gs each s@@ ong t@@ wi@@ ce over .
do you know if he is av@@ ai@@ l@@ able ? I need to know in order to make an appoin@@ t@@ ment with him .
don &apos;t forget about me .
we lost against our ri@@ v@@ al on pri@@ ce .
let me buy you a drink .
if you were in my place , what would you do ?
because I speak Ch@@ in@@ ese .
have you been told the reas@@ ons why we didn &apos;t hi@@ re you ?
do you watch tel@@ ev@@ ision ?
I never should &apos;ve let you go home alone last night .
do you like M@@ o@@ s@@ co@@ w ?
he &apos;s h@@ ell @-@ b@@ ent on fin@@ ding out who killed his daughter .
that bed is very com@@ for@@ table .
the cri@@ min@@ al is sure to do time for ro@@ b@@ b@@ ing the store .
my children are hun@@ gr@@ y .
I &apos;m sure that Tom is hon@@ est .
her beli@@ ef in G@@ od is very fir@@ m .
he was killed .
no one was in the room .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m telling you this .
language re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ts d@@ ai@@ ly experi@@ ence .
Tom beg@@ an to shi@@ ver vi@@ ol@@ ent@@ ly .
S@@ tr@@ ang@@ ely enough , he fai@@ led .
he should get to your house in an h@@ our .
may we use the language la@@ b ?
you for@@ got to pr@@ acti@@ ce ?
everybody saw it .
that &apos;s enough now !
it &apos;s just five in the morning , but n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess it is light out .
I didn &apos;t mo@@ ve a thing .
my father was a doctor .
in many ways , these fo@@ ss@@ ils are the &apos; smoking g@@ un &apos; just before the em@@ erg@@ ence of our own gen@@ us .
there &apos;s no ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y .
how far do we have to go ?
children g@@ row very qu@@ ick@@ ly .
are you on your way home ?
how can it be that ma@@ th@@ em@@ ati@@ c@@ s , being after all a produ@@ c@@ t of hu@@ man thought in@@ de@@ pend@@ ent of experi@@ ence , is so admi@@ r@@ ab@@ ly ad@@ ap@@ ted to the objec@@ ts of re@@ al@@ ity ?
it &apos;s his word against h@@ ers .
which co@@ lo@@ r do you pre@@ fer , b@@ lu@@ e or gre@@ en ?
the O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ pi@@ c G@@ am@@ es cer@@ em@@ on@@ i@@ ous@@ ly cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate the tri@@ um@@ p@@ h of n@@ ation@@ alis@@ m , do@@ ping and com@@ mer@@ ce .
in the v@@ al@@ le@@ y , the vi@@ o@@ let@@ s came out early .
C@@ y@@ pr@@ us is an is@@ l@@ and .
her sk@@ in was almost trans@@ lu@@ cent .
how could I forget ?
let me buy you a new one .
Tom is s@@ mar@@ t .
let us sing a s@@ ong .
I had a couple of questions , but I didn &apos;t ask them .
F@@ em@@ in@@ ine logi@@ c is not always log@@ ic@@ al .
when we started out , our b@@ and could only find small c@@ lu@@ b@@ s in small ci@@ ti@@ es that would hi@@ re us .
you should resp@@ ect the ru@@ les your parents set for you .
don &apos;t tell Tom about what we plan to do next wee@@ k@@ end .
I told you I have a gir@@ l@@ friend .
I need you right now .
Sami saw Layla hur@@ r@@ ying .
leave our house .
I &apos;ll l@@ end it to you .
I may need to mo@@ ve on .
I believe that he &apos;s happy .
qu@@ it talking , will you ?
they set out for N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k .
I des@@ pi@@ se them .
my cat sle@@ pt next to me .
for@@ give me .
the f@@ lo@@ or is co@@ ver@@ ed with a th@@ ic@@ k car@@ p@@ et .
Tom has a small f@@ ar@@ m not far from Boston .
an anim@@ al can be much more danger@@ ous when w@@ oun@@ ded .
can you dri@@ ve a sti@@ ck shi@@ ft ?
I go to the the@@ at@@ re .
Dan par@@ ked the r@@ ent@@ al car n@@ ear the police station .
where do you want to go for our first les@@ son ?
man is the dog &apos;s best friend .
Tom won@@ der@@ ed why Mary had st@@ ayed in Boston .
I wonder if there &apos;s some way of attr@@ ac@@ ting more Japanese spea@@ k@@ ers to Tatoeba ?
there were no b@@ oun@@ ds to his am@@ bi@@ tion .
P@@ in@@ ea@@ p@@ ple is rich in c@@ it@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id .
we are going to the country .
I know what it &apos;s like to be hear@@ t@@ bro@@ ken .
how did it come about ?
wh@@ ose turn is it to make dinner tonight ?
I thought you &apos;d want to see this mo@@ vie .
did I do all that ?
we &apos;re lu@@ cky to be ali@@ ve .
you can dri@@ ve a car , can &apos;t you ?
as soon as we got to the l@@ ake , we started swimming .
yesterday , he told me the truth .
gi@@ ving up smoking is the eas@@ i@@ est thing in the world . I know because I &apos;ve done it th@@ ous@@ and@@ s of times .
the dog is thir@@ st@@ y .
I heard that a g@@ ay pri@@ est had been prom@@ o@@ ted to the r@@ ank of b@@ is@@ ho@@ p , but it turned out to be a f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ation .
the food isn &apos;t very good here .
what do you me@@ an , &quot; I don &apos;t like it &quot; ?
he had long hair last year .
your question has no answer .
how aw@@ ful !
I hate it when my parents fi@@ ght .
he who does not work does not have the right to eat .
don &apos;t be a str@@ anger .
I know Tom is all right now .
Tom said he would try .
we need to correct those mist@@ a@@ ken as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions .
I would think you have other things to keep you busy .
Sami was five minutes away .
Tom is coming to our school tomorrow .
she lo@@ ved her mother de@@ ar@@ ly .
I plea@@ ded not gu@@ il@@ ty .
we can &apos;t pos@@ t@@ po@@ ne the meeting .
you aren &apos;t invit@@ ed .
long live the g@@ er@@ i@@ o@@ cr@@ ac@@ y !
she cannot play the piano .
m@@ en only think about one thing .
he didn &apos;t do that out of me@@ an@@ ness , but ra@@ ther out of ab@@ sent @-@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness .
yes , I am married .
never talk to str@@ ang@@ ers .
how could you do that ?
I had to go back .
I have a pre@@ di@@ l@@ ec@@ tion for be@@ ef .
you have everything .
Tom told me Mary was busy .
I want to see it .
they must be cr@@ azy to believe such n@@ on@@ sense .
I want you to be qui@@ et .
C@@ o@@ tt@@ on ab@@ sor@@ b@@ s water .
get back to where you started .
I had to work on S@@ un@@ day .
you gu@@ ys su@@ ck .
who &apos;s going to co@@ ok for us ?
what language were they spea@@ king ?
never tell li@@ es .
both al@@ tern@@ ati@@ ves are possible .
may@@ be I should al@@ so ad@@ d senten@@ ces without trans@@ l@@ ations ? it is a very fast way of im@@ pro@@ ving the popul@@ ar@@ ity of one &apos;s own language .
do you want to b@@ et on that ?
we made sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es .
I had only one drink .
I &apos;ve cho@@ s@@ en her to be my wife .
I can &apos;t kis@@ s you the way you want to be kis@@ sed .
stop t@@ wi@@ st@@ ing my ar@@ m !
if he s@@ ends me any let@@ ters , I just t@@ ear them up and th@@ row them away .
I was war@@ ned .
so@@ on@@ er or l@@ ater , Tom will li@@ k@@ ely ag@@ ree to help us .
this is longer than any other bri@@ d@@ ge in the world .
what &apos;s the teacher ex@@ pl@@ ain@@ ing ?
we &apos;d like se@@ par@@ ate ch@@ ec@@ ks .
who wouldn &apos;t want to live here ?
we &apos;re cro@@ s@@ sing the bor@@ der .
who is next ?
are you sure you &apos;re war@@ m enough ?
I don &apos;t know who my anc@@ es@@ t@@ ors are . our pap@@ ers got lost du@@ ring the F@@ lo@@ od .
s@@ it down and sh@@ ut up .
it &apos;ll rain for sure .
it &apos;s not on the men@@ u .
Tom is the only one who doesn &apos;t know .
I went to the su@@ per@@ mar@@ ket .
D@@ ro@@ pl@@ ets are fall@@ ing on my l@@ ap@@ top com@@ puter .
I am sure .
I believe him to be intelligent .
I study English at home .
I &apos;m still a m@@ ember .
this kind of work makes me hun@@ gr@@ y .
smoking is bad for your heal@@ th .
In@@ de@@ ed , d@@ war@@ f to@@ s@@ sing is an O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ pi@@ c s@@ port !
yes , I &apos;m afraid so .
you should keep your prom@@ is@@ es .
I just want to be per@@ f@@ ect .
I &apos;m glad I invit@@ ed you .
there is only one truth .
man has a great cap@@ ac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ al chang@@ es .
I wonder what has become of him after he went to Americ@@ a .
I don &apos;t have much inter@@ est in co@@ o@@ king .
Tom asked me to be here .
you look g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous in that dress .
he isn &apos;t du@@ m@@ ber than you .
I still can &apos;t believe I &apos;m going to be on your tea@@ m .
come and keep me company .
why are you pic@@ king a fi@@ ght with me ?
his k@@ in@@ d@@ ness tou@@ ched my heart .
he stu@@ di@@ es bi@@ o@@ log@@ y very hard .
my un@@ cle is rich .
to be per@@ f@@ ect she l@@ ac@@ ked just one de@@ f@@ ect .
I hear him fall@@ ing .
you don &apos;t have to be a vi@@ c@@ ti@@ m .
which way is the b@@ each ?
I just need you to help me .
can I have some more ri@@ ce , please ?
don &apos;t talk ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish !
Sami lived very close to the lo@@ c@@ ation where Layla &apos;s body was found .
the su@@ sp@@ ect is a cau@@ cas@@ i@@ an fem@@ ale .
he pain@@ ted a dog .
where did you hi@@ de the food ?
I get ch@@ app@@ ed li@@ ps every win@@ ter .
they dec@@ ei@@ ved us .
my fe@@ et are cold .
Mary accep@@ ted everything without compl@@ ain@@ ing .
he &apos;s an ex@@ or@@ c@@ ist .
it &apos;s your turn to sing .
they were s@@ col@@ ded by the teacher .
our es@@ cap@@ e was nothing shor@@ t of a mi@@ rac@@ le .
I &apos;ll never do this again .
I sur@@ viv@@ ed .
this gl@@ ass isn &apos;t mine .
it &apos;s hard to cho@@ ose .
my dog has c@@ anc@@ er .
do you remember the day this pic@@ ture was ta@@ ken ?
what did she do to you ?
C@@ re@@ ating Tatoeba was a good idea .
are you happy here ?
she che@@ ated on the t@@ est .
can I speak to you a moment ?
they sto@@ od on the h@@ ill@@ top .
I &apos;ve never felt like this before .
what &apos;s your f@@ avo@@ rite sk@@ in care produ@@ c@@ t ?
you can b@@ orrow three books at a time .
I &apos;m in ab@@ solu@@ tel@@ y to@@ t@@ al ag@@ re@@ ement .
this car is his .
I &apos;m sure Tom and Mary will be tired when they get home .
I wouldn &apos;t go with you for anything .
he made up the whole story .
you &apos;re finished already .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen to you .
everybody nee@@ ds to know this .
f@@ all is late this year .
they &apos;re on good ter@@ ms with their nei@@ gh@@ b@@ ors .
I &apos;m us@@ ing a new com@@ puter .
Mary always stu@@ di@@ es for two hours a day .
what did she do with it ?
it &apos;s a ru@@ le .
who are you clo@@ s@@ est to in your family ?
you &apos;re wor@@ se than Tom .
do the Ger@@ m@@ ans have any other concer@@ n@@ s in life a@@ part from con@@ su@@ mer@@ is@@ m ?
you should not resp@@ ect a man because he is rich .
the ch@@ air cre@@ a@@ ked as he s@@ at down .
he ex@@ press@@ ed his beli@@ ef in her hon@@ es@@ ty .
only they th@@ em@@ sel@@ ves understand what they say .
no , he has@@ n &apos;t said anything about it .
everyone is going to call me a li@@ ar .
the child was cr@@ ying for her mother .
they ru@@ in@@ ed it .
they want p@@ ea@@ ce .
are we being char@@ g@@ ed with something ?
I really hate d@@ ai@@ ry produ@@ c@@ ts .
I was right on the spo@@ t when it happened .
be pun@@ ctu@@ al .
I am f@@ our@@ te@@ en years old .
you look so p@@ ale .
I really don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
that &apos;s it . I &apos;ve done all I can do .
the a@@ ar@@ d@@ v@@ ar@@ k is a me@@ di@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ zed anim@@ al .
the school ru@@ les re@@ qu@@ ire students to w@@ ear school uni@@ form@@ s .
where can I buy books ?

you &apos;re being par@@ an@@ o@@ id .
I &apos;m lu@@ cky to have you as a friend .
I have to say that I &apos;m sorry .
I admi@@ re her efforts .
we can &apos;t get close to the en@@ em@@ y .
there are a lot of star@@ s lar@@ ger than our own S@@ un .
they aren &apos;t du@@ m@@ ber than you .
can &apos;t this wait until things are back to nor@@ mal ?
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school yet .
my mother is a very good co@@ ok .
are you watching the pres@@ id@@ enti@@ al de@@ b@@ ate ?
you were right .
now I am free .
who sp@@ read these ru@@ m@@ ours ?
that was wri@@ tten by T@@ ar@@ o A@@ k@@ ag@@ aw@@ a .
she made it clear that she couldn &apos;t make it in time for the meeting .
I know you consi@@ der@@ ed me a close friend .
things will only get wor@@ se .
the girl is drin@@ king te@@ a .
I &apos;m surprised to see you .
this is your fau@@ l@@ t .
she met him on the b@@ each .
they arrived at the ho@@ tel .
is your name Layla ?
I can &apos;t do this job alone .
I had go@@ tten no sleep the night before , so I k@@ ept dro@@ p@@ ping off du@@ ring the meeting .
haven &apos;t you e@@ at@@ en yet ?
don &apos;t talk to me about r@@ eli@@ gi@@ on .
who is there ?
he is str@@ on@@ ger than me .
I sw@@ o@@ re I &apos;d never do that .
the dog came run@@ ning to me .
Tom is th@@ ro@@ wing st@@ ones at bir@@ ds .
yesterday was a good day .
Tom is a bad co@@ ac@@ h .
she died last night .
I &apos;m waiting for the bus .
this ru@@ g was made without the use of child l@@ ab@@ or .
death before di@@ sh@@ on@@ or !
I o@@ il@@ ed my bicy@@ cle .
turn around .
this is not necess@@ ary .
we want re@@ ven@@ ge .
put on your sho@@ es . let &apos;s go out for dinner .
you &apos;re fai@@ th@@ ful .
the train should be here on time .
I &apos;d be un@@ happy if that happened again .
this show is stupi@@ d .
write S@@ pan@@ ish .
don &apos;t even think of as@@ king me what I think about you right now .
I don &apos;t care if it s@@ no@@ ws .
there &apos;s someone I want you to meet .
I &apos;m not wri@@ ting about you .
your question is not rel@@ ev@@ ant to the sub@@ j@@ ect .
she came to see me .
this ch@@ air is too small .
how much time do you actu@@ ally spend thinking about the future ?
I don &apos;t know who you want to meet .
if the do@@ ors of per@@ c@@ ep@@ tion were cle@@ an@@ sed everything would app@@ ear to man as it is , in@@ fin@@ ite .
be@@ er is my fu@@ el .
don &apos;t forget to ti@@ p the porter for car@@ r@@ ying your lu@@ gg@@ age .
many great thin@@ k@@ ers who were un@@ known while ali@@ ve became fam@@ ous after death .
you &apos;re a terri@@ ble person .
it is difficult to get him to do anything on the s@@ pu@@ r of the moment .
in N@@ or@@ we@@ gi@@ an , &apos; d &apos; and &apos; t &apos; at the end of a word are gen@@ er@@ ally sil@@ ent .
how many times do I have to tell you not to eat c@@ and@@ y just before dinner ?
no one can do that .
I have some in@@ side information about the company &apos;s pl@@ ans to go public .
do you know the man star@@ ing at you ?
no so@@ on@@ er had he seen it than he turned p@@ ale .
everyone knows we &apos;re rich .
I app@@ reci@@ ate the senti@@ ment .
I &apos;m rich .
fin@@ ish drin@@ king your milk .
the old man died from hun@@ ger .
20@@ 1@@ 6 is coming to an end and a new year is about to beg@@ in !
you &apos;re the ol@@ d@@ est .
I sle@@ pt for ei@@ ght hours last night .
are you here alone ?
anyone could do that .
he is good for nothing .
do you like music ?
take mine .
why don &apos;t you tell me something I don &apos;t know ?
this is not what I or@@ der@@ ed .
this is such a was@@ te of time .
Tom is always play@@ ing vi@@ de@@ o g@@ am@@ es .
I have been to the store before .
stop s@@ end@@ ing me flow@@ ers .
please un@@ dress from the wai@@ st up .
that &apos;s a stupi@@ d question !
why don &apos;t you have dinner with me tonight ?
are you ready for the trip ?
you need to be more careful from now on .
can you look at me ?
did you re@@ gi@@ st@@ er your produ@@ c@@ t ?
Dan had to dec@@ ide wh@@ om to believe .
you must give up smoking , as it is un@@ heal@@ th@@ y .
there is a tel@@ ev@@ ision in my room .
they &apos;re looking for you .
I &apos;m trying to cle@@ an the house .
I haven &apos;t used An@@ k@@ i in a week and now I have 5@@ 00 fl@@ as@@ h@@ car@@ ds du@@ e .
the questions came fast and fu@@ ri@@ ous from the large number of re@@ por@@ ters who had g@@ ath@@ ered out@@ side the cour@@ th@@ ouse .
I remember those days .
are you really as old as you say you are ?
Sami didn &apos;t really like that girl .
I can &apos;t get the c@@ a@@ p off this bo@@ ttle .
I re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ zed her at first gl@@ ance .
I want to talk to you alone .
we &apos;d better leave her alone .
Al@@ th@@ ough Mary is sick , she will work .
happy is the man who is con@@ ten@@ ted .
I was bo@@ red .
if I were heal@@ th@@ y , I would be happy .
she has left us .
she asked him for some money .
I &apos;m not really that thir@@ st@@ y .
have fun with that .
there is something tr@@ op@@ ic@@ al and ex@@ o@@ tic about her which form@@ s a sin@@ gu@@ l@@ ar contr@@ ast to her co@@ ol and un@@ em@@ o@@ tion@@ al brother .
go there tomorrow !
nobody would list@@ en to me .
I can &apos;t pro@@ ve it , you &apos;ll have to take my word for it .
do you have a sho@@ v@@ el I can b@@ orrow ?
you have chang@@ ed since I saw you last year .
e@@ en@@ y , me@@ en@@ y , min@@ y , mo@@ e , cat@@ ch a ti@@ ger by his to@@ e , if he ho@@ ll@@ ers let him go , e@@ en@@ y , me@@ en@@ y , min@@ y , mo@@ e . my mother told me to cat@@ ch the very best one and you are not it .
I &apos;ll go first .
how could anyone be so stupi@@ d ?
there &apos;s no ex@@ it .
it &apos;s on the so@@ f@@ a .
we &apos;re looking for a place to sleep .
there &apos;s a du@@ ck on her shi@@ rt .
it &apos;s easy to have a clear con@@ sci@@ ence when it &apos;s not used .
are you ve@@ get@@ ari@@ an ?
if you want something to be done right , sometimes you &apos;ve just got to do it yourself .
the wor@@ k@@ ers are against the new plan .
they st@@ ayed in the room with me for the whole night .
she gave me good advice .
P@@ r@@ ay for all of us .
my brother de@@ p@@ ends on me for money .
this isn &apos;t where I par@@ ked my car .
I want to sor@@ t this out once and for all .
don &apos;t let go of my hand , or you &apos;ll get lost .
she &apos;s str@@ ong @-@ w@@ illed .
don &apos;t ask me again .
are you b@@ low@@ ing me off ?
I can &apos;t believe I did this .
the teacher conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated a student &apos;s phone because he was t@@ ex@@ ting in class .
J@@ i@@ m has@@ n &apos;t come yet .
do you want something cold to drink ?
P@@ re@@ histo@@ ri@@ c m@@ en were sk@@ illed in k@@ n@@ app@@ ing .
we should h@@ ang out .
I found the book which I had lost the day before .
I didn &apos;t hear a s@@ pl@@ as@@ h .
I don &apos;t mind l@@ end@@ ing you the money pro@@ vi@@ ded you pay it back with@@ in a mon@@ th .
A@@ h ... ok@@ ay , I was young , but what a stupi@@ d mist@@ ake !
in fac@@ t , I should thank you for this .
I was ar@@ res@@ ted on the spo@@ t .
I &apos;m stu@@ d@@ ying art at school .
that never was an is@@ su@@ e .
you should really l@@ ay off that . it &apos;ll ru@@ in your heal@@ th .
the me@@ dic@@ ine had no eff@@ ect .
this is a book .
he doesn &apos;t get jo@@ kes .
that &apos;s not good enough for Tom .
it &apos;s a ser@@ ies of tu@@ bes .
Tom is here some@@ where .
Tom sto@@ od very close to Mary .
he re@@ main@@ ed sil@@ ent the whole time .
Tom &apos;s French pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation isn &apos;t as good as he thin@@ ks it is .
will they el@@ ect him for four more years ?
I got up too early .
since it r@@ ain@@ ed , I st@@ ayed home .
Tom put a st@@ ar on top of the Ch@@ rist@@ m@@ as t@@ ree .
we &apos;re not in school anymore .
I w@@ ake up at 7 o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck .
they have a plan .
Tom did a good job .
Tom never said he wanted to go with us .
do you want some su@@ g@@ ar in your coffee ?
are you free tomorrow af@@ ter@@ noon ?
we &apos;re under att@@ ack !
it &apos;s very late .
the whole village knows the man well .
are you up for it ?
bi@@ te the bu@@ ll@@ et .
I went to bed at tw@@ el@@ ve last night .
the eff@@ ect was im@@ me@@ di@@ ate .
Mary has a new lo@@ ver .
what co@@ lo@@ r is Mary &apos;s s@@ car@@ f ?
may I eat another pie@@ ce of c@@ ake ?
you never get a secon@@ d chance to make a first im@@ pres@@ sion .
he &apos;s all@@ er@@ gi@@ c to c@@ ats .
get on your k@@ ne@@ es .
is there a problem I should know about ?
Dan is now wanted by the police .
you &apos;d better tell the truth .
it was r@@ ain@@ ing heav@@ ily when I got up this morning .
I called her , but the l@@ ine was busy .
I have a co@@ at , but I don &apos;t have a h@@ at .
I can &apos;t leave off smoking .
you are was@@ h@@ ing di@@ sh@@ es .
this won &apos;t sol@@ ve anything .
sometimes T@@ on@@ y vis@@ ited his family .
arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelli@@ g@@ ence can now coll@@ ect information from soci@@ al me@@ di@@ a and the inter@@ n@@ et to help des@@ ign@@ ers understand what the public likes .
I love to trav@@ el .
Tom has a b@@ right car@@ e@@ er as a me@@ dic@@ al doctor .

ch@@ ic@@ ken po@@ x is a com@@ mon si@@ ck@@ ness in children .
I can &apos;t tell you exactly how long it will take .
H@@ ence , lo@@ ath@@ ed m@@ el@@ an@@ cho@@ ly .
I was bo@@ red because I had seen the mo@@ vie before .
I believe that story .
Tom &apos;s grand@@ mother looks heal@@ th@@ y .
they &apos;re all in there .
many years ago fl@@ ying used to be gl@@ am@@ or@@ ous . now it &apos;s just a pain in the nec@@ k !
I admi@@ re your pers@@ ever@@ ance and det@@ ermin@@ ation .
he gave her a p@@ ec@@ k on the ch@@ ee@@ k .
our gu@@ es@@ ts are in a hurry .
he went to bed .
which one should I use ?
Tom in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced Mary to his mother .
in Euro@@ pe , people re@@ g@@ ard pun@@ ctu@@ al@@ ity as a matter of cour@@ se .
get a room already !
most of these are mine .
Tom &apos;s dog has four le@@ gs .
many young people are out of work in that country .
why don &apos;t I have a bo@@ y@@ friend ?
I &apos;ll talk to you l@@ ater .
we had to make a dec@@ ision .
B@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant !
I think this is bes@@ ide the point , right now .
this is a dog .
I need to go sho@@ p@@ ping .

I miss you .
I am a cat . I don &apos;t have a name yet .

I really like that gu@@ y .

a black and wh@@ ite dog bit me .
the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens im@@ me@@ diat@@ ely pre@@ par@@ ed everything to de@@ f@@ end the city .
I &apos;m going to jo@@ in a dem@@ on@@ str@@ ation .
I had a good sleep last night .
come on , T@@ on@@ y .
I don &apos;t feel so spec@@ i@@ al .
Tom is resp@@ ected by everybody .
this book is much more us@@ eful than that one .
A@@ chi@@ ev@@ ing a nice w@@ el@@ d b@@ ead is not with@@ in everyone &apos;s re@@ ac@@ h !
someone sp@@ i@@ ked her drink .
if he &apos;s still ali@@ ve , he &apos;d be very old by now .
would you tr@@ ust them ?
I wish I could live in a house that nice .
how long have you been di@@ v@@ or@@ ced ?
I &apos;m what the world call@@ s an idi@@ ot .
that seems like a lot .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
it &apos;s a little cold today .
he cannot speak English , much less Ger@@ man .
where exactly do you live ?
I went to the pos@@ t office .
I &apos;d like to w@@ el@@ come you all ab@@ o@@ ard .
I will let you know in ad@@ v@@ ance .
he is mil@@ es away .

I can &apos;t help myself .
I was there last night .
they who dre@@ am by day are co@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ ant of many things which es@@ cap@@ e those who dre@@ am only by night .
are you sure that you want to go there ?
he went back home .
this morning the weather is cl@@ ou@@ dy .
how could you not say something ?
in all li@@ k@@ eli@@ ho@@ od , we sh@@ all be away for a few days .
what ve@@ get@@ ables do you usu@@ ally g@@ row ?
if I were rich , I &apos;d buy a car .
he bro@@ ke down when he heard the bad news .
I don &apos;t know which bu@@ tt@@ on to p@@ ush .
she is next to them .
he doesn &apos;t even remember what happened last night .
I &apos;m well aw@@ are of the ris@@ k .
I love c@@ ab@@ b@@ age !
stop correc@@ ting me .
Tom put too much su@@ g@@ ar in my coffee .
th@@ ous@@ and@@ s of people wanted to know the answer .
there are some things that are difficult to trans@@ late .
are they ta@@ king care of you ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to buy a new car .
we want nat@@ ur@@ al @-@ s@@ oun@@ ding trans@@ l@@ ations , not word @-@ for @-@ word direc@@ t trans@@ l@@ ations .
this is how you get res@@ ul@@ ts .

I sw@@ ear to G@@ od , if one more person here s@@ ays &quot; gi@@ ant ro@@ bo@@ t , &quot; you &apos;re all as good as d@@ ead .
I think that Tom is still sleep@@ ing .
I don &apos;t think I can keep that promise .
you used to smo@@ ke , didn &apos;t you ?
str@@ ange to say , the teacher didn &apos;t s@@ cold me .
I don &apos;t feel like it .
they started all at once .
he went ab@@ o@@ ard the plan@@ e .

he pl@@ ays the gu@@ it@@ ar .
mine is better than yours .
I &apos;m aw@@ ake .
I am not under@@ stand@@ ing what the au@@ th@@ or is trying to say .
I guess I didn &apos;t want to dis@@ ap@@ point you .
I know that &apos;s not what you want .
don &apos;t sleep with the windo@@ ws open .

please give me a sp@@ are bl@@ an@@ ket .
why do I have to sing with Tom ?
Tom and Mary vis@@ ited S@@ c@@ and@@ in@@ av@@ ia .

S@@ u@@ ck@@ ers !
even th@@ ough he has turned tw@@ ent@@ y , he &apos;s still too ti@@ mi@@ d to chat with girls .

G@@ il@@ ded re@@ ins do not make for a better hor@@ se .
how heav@@ y you are !
the si@@ ze of the uni@@ ver@@ se is un@@ imag@@ in@@ able .
how do you read this k@@ an@@ j@@ i ?
our t@@ ask has been easy so far , but it will be difficult from now on .
she will make a good wife .
I could have pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ed this .
trav@@ el@@ ing was much more difficult in those days .
this is what I bought in S@@ pain .
I &apos;m very interested in the ev@@ o@@ lution of the din@@ o@@ sau@@ rs .
Tom &apos;s co@@ o@@ king .
Dan dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ed that his wife had been un@@ fai@@ th@@ ful .
I will meet you at the station at 10 a@@ .@@ m .
any play o@@ pen@@ ing to bad re@@ vie@@ ws won &apos;t last long .

Tom pou@@ red Mary a cu@@ p of coffee .
he fell as@@ le@@ ep du@@ ring class .
put the e@@ g@@ gs in the fri@@ d@@ ge .
I want a hot sho@@ wer before I go back to work .
I ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that she was right .
didn &apos;t I tell you so ?
we can believe everything .
there is no telling exactly when the ear@@ th was born .
I &apos;ll tell my m@@ om on you !
we used to s@@ it on these st@@ e@@ ps and talk .
we have all k@@ in@@ ds of time .
it is too dar@@ k for me to read .
why didn &apos;t you read the mag@@ az@@ ine ?
she &apos;s busy now , so she can &apos;t talk with you .
I can &apos;t understand why you are so cri@@ ti@@ cal of him .
my br@@ ain is fri@@ ed .
you aren &apos;t in a hurry , are you ?
are you afraid of it ?
she al@@ low@@ ed him to go alone .
I think Tom killed himself .
my sk@@ ir@@ t is too long .
do you speak Ger@@ man ?
watch the fr@@ ont .
I have only just arrived .
I have another en@@ gag@@ ement .
how does Tom plan to help ?
are you st@@ aying for dinner ?
Tom will be here every day .
is this b@@ ab@@ y a he or a she ?
wh@@ e@@ ther to trans@@ late is a mor@@ al cho@@ ice of the trans@@ l@@ at@@ or . sometimes things are better to be left alone in the language which produ@@ ced them .
this man &apos;s ram@@ bl@@ ings are the fu@@ r@@ th@@ est from the truth I &apos;ve ever heard !
I can hear you l@@ ou@@ d and clear .
we &apos;ll do the same for you .
Tom is con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly compl@@ ain@@ ing .

I couldn &apos;t br@@ ing myself to tell her the truth .
I s@@ at at the b@@ ar .
Tom wants people to p@@ ity him .
I had to cli@@ m@@ b over the f@@ ence .
I &apos;ll do anything I can for Tom .
I ad@@ vi@@ se you to not dis@@ cour@@ age me !
she nee@@ ded the enti@@ re af@@ ter@@ noon for that job .
I thought that was the right thing to do .
lo@@ sing your heal@@ th is wor@@ se than lo@@ sing your money .

F@@ ill in this for@@ m .
I wasn &apos;t at home last night .

I took a sho@@ wer .
I had a h@@ ea@@ d@@ ache , so I couldn &apos;t do that .

I promise I &apos;ll be qui@@ et .
is there a differ@@ ence between the way of thinking of m@@ en and wom@@ en ?
we are aw@@ ai@@ ting im@@ pati@@ ent@@ ly the arriv@@ al of our d@@ ear friend .

I &apos;ll keep your advice in mind .

this ri@@ ce has too much saf@@ fr@@ on .
he tried to give up smoking but in v@@ ain .
Tom should at le@@ ast w@@ ear a ti@@ e .

he turned p@@ ale the instant he saw her .
I want to visit Austr@@ ali@@ a one day .

there &apos;s nothing I can do to dis@@ su@@ ade him .
why are you cr@@ ying ?
you must not en@@ ter the room .

Sami did the right thing , I think .
you don &apos;t necess@@ ar@@ ily have to go .
you have to work , not think .
we do not have enough str@@ eng@@ th to fol@@ low our reas@@ on fu@@ l@@ ly .

I &apos;ll find another job .
I saw him kis@@ sing another girl .

he in@@ t@@ ends to buy a new bicy@@ cle .
his succ@@ ess is out of question .
she tel@@ ls him to give her all of his sal@@ ary and he does .
I never w@@ in .
let &apos;s find a saf@@ e place to hi@@ de .
I s@@ at between Tom and John .
at that time , bicy@@ c@@ les were just star@@ ting to get popul@@ ar and , here and there , there were many un@@ sk@@ illed beg@@ in@@ n@@ ers who r@@ an into people and bro@@ ke through their he@@ d@@ g@@ es .
please do as it seems best to you .
Tom has enough money to buy the house he wants .
the li@@ br@@ ari@@ an said we nee@@ ded to be qui@@ et .
B@@ er@@ n@@ ard of Ch@@ ar@@ tres used to say that we are like d@@ war@@ fs on the sh@@ oul@@ der@@ s of gi@@ ants , so that we can see more than they , and things at a gre@@ ater dist@@ ance , not by vir@@ tu@@ e of any sh@@ ar@@ p@@ ness of si@@ ght on our part , or any ph@@ y@@ si@@ cal dist@@ in@@ c@@ tion , but because we are c@@ arried high and rais@@ ed up by their gi@@ ant si@@ ze .
is it true that Tom won the ra@@ ce ?
there &apos;s a black ho@@ le at the cen@@ ter of our g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y .
he comes to meet me sometimes .
a fu@@ se has blo@@ wn .
I might be back before you leave .
pri@@ ces went up .

I had some things to do .
have you ever made a p@@ ie before ?
my leav@@ ing early made them feel sorry .
you said you figu@@ red out why .
how did that whole thing happen ?
you aren &apos;t the eas@@ i@@ est person to live with .
go up these st@@ ai@@ rs .

I sing the s@@ ong of him wh@@ ose bre@@ ad I eat .
the ai@@ r@@ port is quite far from the city c@@ entre .
we know that he &apos;s a br@@ ave man .
I didn &apos;t tell you everything .

I know where you live .

I think we should all go to Tom &apos;s house .
that was because my watch was five minutes s@@ low .
that &apos;s only a to@@ y .
he almost con@@ vin@@ ced me .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m ready for this .
I we@@ ig@@ h about 6@@ 0 k@@ il@@ o@@ s .
he sav@@ ed money for the trip .
one of the play@@ ers took off his shi@@ rt .
it wasn &apos;t all that f@@ un@@ ny .
I used to look up to him , but not anymore .
swimming is easy for me .
S@@ el@@ ect ac@@ tion for Ch@@ r@@ is .
are you lo@@ sing your mind ?
how was the f@@ light ?
when did I tell you that ?
by the time you got there , the su@@ n had set .
why don &apos;t I call you ?
all langu@@ ages are e@@ qu@@ al , but English is more e@@ qu@@ al than the others .
you must take your co@@ at in c@@ ase it should become cold .
bu@@ tt@@ on your co@@ at up .
she &apos;s un@@ fit for the job .
these pl@@ ates aren &apos;t cle@@ an .
our tea@@ m lost the first game .

I think Tom was looking for you .
I think I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have married you .
I was born on J@@ une 4 , 19@@ 7@@ 4 .
I didn &apos;t know you were so tired .
the f@@ ly run@@ ning on the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r doesn &apos;t worry about its re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion on the poin@@ ts of its le@@ gs from which it s@@ its and run@@ s ; but on the contr@@ ary , it se@@ es on the smo@@ o@@ th sur@@ face a qu@@ an@@ ti@@ ty of very small things which inter@@ est it and which we con@@ fu@@ se with d@@ ust and g@@ ri@@ me .

I think we should s@@ ell our old car .
