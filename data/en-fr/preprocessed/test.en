Tom didn &apos;t know how to re@@ act .
he had dinner by himself .
O@@ ri@@ on is saf@@ ely back to E@@ ar@@ th .
everybody had a good year .
I told him not to come back .
I would ra@@ ther not go .
the nei@@ gh@@ b@@ ors sent their k@@ id on a l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tic trip to I@@ rel@@ and this summer .

th@@ an@@ ks to this book , I lear@@ ned some interes@@ ting fac@@ ts about this in@@ s@@ ect .
I think Tom is aw@@ ake .
there was always too much su@@ per@@ flu@@ ous wri@@ ting in his ess@@ ays .
I figu@@ red you &apos;d be here .
we ch@@ at@@ ted together .
have you tried this water ?
to become a prof@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al ban@@ j@@ o play@@ er , you need to spend th@@ ous@@ and@@ s of hours pr@@ acti@@ c@@ ing .
I must &apos;ve par@@ ked my car el@@ se@@ where .
at the most , the trip will cost $ 1@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 .
you speak my language .
he doesn &apos;t like to wait until the last moment to do something .
this is correct .
she had to sh@@ are a be@@ d@@ room with her sister .
is he a friend of yours ?
these ch@@ ai@@ rs are differ@@ ent .
how can one be seri@@ ous with the world when the world it@@ self is so ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous !
&quot; look - there &apos;s a fi@@ re ! ! &quot; E@@ x@@ cl@@ aim@@ ed Dan .
you can &apos;t buy this me@@ dic@@ ine without a pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion .

Tom , who is kind , will be glad to do anything for me .
it won &apos;t be easy to forget you .
are you looking for your parents ?
I want to thank you for hel@@ ping me .
what are you doing now ?
those who have a long hair own a hai@@ r@@ dri@@ er .
you were s@@ car@@ ed , w@@ er@@ en &apos;t you ?
is it your bi@@ ke ?
I know that Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
what stu@@ f@@ f is this j@@ ac@@ ket made of ?

I &apos;m not em@@ barrass@@ ed at all .
who would you like to speak to ?
I &apos;d like to help them if I can .

I think Tom is amus@@ ing .
I ate a light lun@@ ch .
what are you wri@@ ting ?
I still have other things to do .
he chang@@ ed his ad@@ dress .

&quot; is he ali@@ ve or d@@ ead ? &quot; &quot; he &apos;s ali@@ ve . &quot;
tell me about your wife .
they are very comp@@ ati@@ ble .
it doesn &apos;t b@@ el@@ ong to you .
there &apos;s a table .
she wor@@ ked for a rich man .
having finished the work , he went to bed .
I &apos;ve seen you on TV many times .
are you up ?
he was patient .
the o@@ per@@ ation was really tou@@ ch and go there for a@@ while but the doctor thin@@ ks he &apos;ll pu@@ ll through .
since he could not work out the problem that way , he tried another way .
my grand@@ father is still str@@ on@@ g@@ ly an@@ cho@@ red in my heart .
don &apos;t th@@ row anything on@@ to the f@@ lo@@ or .
no , just the one .
I &apos;m bre@@ ast @-@ fe@@ e@@ ding my b@@ ab@@ y .

I can &apos;t promise anything , but I &apos;ll do my best .
thank you for ma@@ king it so easy .
I want you to meet my parents .
my father doesn &apos;t eat fru@@ it that much .
I &apos;m h@@ ang@@ ing a pic@@ ture of my grand@@ mother on the w@@ all .

I rel@@ ayed the mess@@ age to Tom .
you &apos;ll soon get used to spea@@ king in public .
does that trou@@ ble you ?
are you laugh@@ ing at me ?
Tom was@@ h@@ es his hair every day .
Tom &apos;s friends called him M@@ r money b@@ ag@@ s .
we &apos;ll never know the truth about his death .
all you have to do is wait .
what is it this time ?
I took her ar@@ m .
it must be morning , for the bir@@ ds are sin@@ g@@ ing .
I would have bought that car if I &apos;d had the money .
this word is both a n@@ ou@@ n and a ver@@ b .
she ir@@ on@@ ed his shi@@ r@@ ts .
I think you should open an ac@@ coun@@ t here .
have you ever read any Ch@@ in@@ ese po@@ ems ?
how do you know which one is yours ?
you won &apos;t go , will you ?
this is do@@ able .
as I thought , she &apos;s a vir@@ g@@ in !

he &apos;s wri@@ ting a long letter .
you must take care of your dog yourself .
he enjo@@ y@@ ed himself .
the res@@ ul@@ ts were ne@@ g@@ ative .
the Japanese eat ri@@ ce at le@@ ast once a day .
I cat@@ ch the fl@@ u every year .
that &apos;s why I sent for you .
it t@@ as@@ tes very good .
Oh , I haven &apos;t decided what I &apos;m going to do yet .
at this time , there &apos;s no saf@@ er place to be than right here .
there are many tou@@ ri@@ sts in the city on ho@@ li@@ days .
he likes wal@@ king in the par@@ k .
do you think so ?
stay out of the water .
